# CDR Dry-run Closeout

- Decision: ACCEPT
- Gates:
  - Pass rate: 100%
  - Flaky rate: 0.00%
  - Criticals: 0
- Baseline: vX.Y.Z-cdr
- Evidence:
  - Smoke log: `dry_run/07_smoke_run_final.log`
  - Metrics: `dry_run/08_metrics.md` (24/24 passed; wall 8s)
  - Environmental audit: `dry_run/environmental_audit.md`
  - IV&V verification: `dry_run/environmental_verification.md`

## Residual Risks
- Minor pytest warning observed (event loop close) during system validation; non-blocking. Monitor in CDR for recurrence.
- Environment stability recovered after bulk dependency install; monitor for drift.

## Next Steps (CDR Handoffs)
- Step 4–6: Consolidate performance baselines and stability metrics from smoke log and durations section
- Step 8: Security/auth flows validated post env fix—include PyJWT/bcrypt presence in CDR checklist
- Step 9: Prepare artifact bundle (logs, rpc_trace, env docs) for CDR package

## PM → All (to post)
Dry-run decision: ACCEPT. Gates: pass=100%, flaky=0.00%, criticals=0. Next steps: proceed to CDR steps 4–6/8/9; package evidence under `dry_run/` and finalize metrics.
