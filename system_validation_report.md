## System Validation Report

### Scope and Method
- Black-box end-to-end validation using real dependencies where available
- No code changes; exercised the running system via external interfaces
- Environment: Linux 5.15; Python 3.10.12; MediaMTX v1.13.1; FFmpeg 4.4.2

### Test Environment Summary
- MediaMTX: launched with API on 9997, RTSP 8554, HLS 8888, WebRTC 8889
- Camera Service: started on `ws://127.0.0.1:8002/ws` with development logging, recordings `/tmp/ivv_recordings`, snapshots `/tmp/ivv_snapshots`
- Real cameras: none detected (`/dev/video*` absent)

### Use Case Execution Results
- Service startup: WORKING
- WebSocket connection and basic API (ping, get_status, get_metrics, get_camera_list): WORKING
- MediaMTX API connectivity (controller health via `/v3/config/global/get`): WORKING
- Auth enforcement for protected methods (snapshot/recording): WORKING
- Camera discovery and stream creation (real devices): UNTESTED (no cameras present)
- Recording to filesystem: UNTESTED (auth + stream preconditions not satisfied)
- Snapshot capture: UNTESTED (auth + stream preconditions not satisfied)

### Performance Characteristics
- WebSocket connect: ~30.2 ms
- JSON-RPC:
  - ping: ~0.48 ms
  - get_status: ~4.07 ms
  - get_metrics: ~1.40 ms
  - get_camera_list (0 devices): ~0.99 ms
- Resource usage (steady state, idle):
  - Camera Service (python3): ~1.3% CPU, ~36 MB RSS, Threads: 3
  - MediaMTX: ~0% CPU, ~20 MB RSS, Threads: 9

### Integration Points
- MediaMTX API (v3 config endpoints): FUNCTIONAL
- WebSocket JSON-RPC server: FUNCTIONAL
- Security middleware (JWT/API key) enforcement: FUNCTIONAL (successful operations require valid credentials)
- Camera discovery (UDev/polling): UNTESTED (no `/dev/video*`)
- FFmpeg media operations (publish, snapshot, record): UNTESTED
- Filesystem artifacts (recordings/snapshots): UNTESTED

### Requirement Coverage
- API responsiveness targets (<50–100 ms): VERIFIED (measured <5 ms for exercised methods)
- Service startup and health monitoring: VERIFIED (controller health via MediaMTX config endpoint)
- Camera lifecycle (detect → stream → record → snapshot): UNVERIFIED (no cameras present)
- FFmpeg integration for snapshot/recording: UNVERIFIED
- Access control (auth required for protected ops): VERIFIED (enforced)

### Observed Gaps (Spec vs Reality)
- Health endpoint path mismatch: real system (MediaMTX v1.13.1) serves config/health under `/v3/config/global/get`; test suite expected `/v3/health` (404). Action: align tests to installed MediaMTX version or implement version-adaptive checks.
- Protected operations require valid credentials; no valid API key/JWT was provisioned during test. Action: provision test API key (32 chars) at configured storage path or set dev overrides.
- No physical cameras available in this run; end-to-end camera workflows could not be executed against real hardware.

### Substitution Strategy (when hardware unavailable)
- Use MediaMTX on-demand paths with FFmpeg test source to simulate a camera stream:
  - Create path `camera0` via MediaMTX API with `runOnDemand: ffmpeg -re -f lavfi -i testsrc=... -f rtsp rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/camera0`
  - Trigger publisher by briefly probing `rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/camera0`
  - Map device `/dev/video0` to stream name `camera0` for snapshot/recording via service conventions (or call controller methods directly with `camera0`)
- Authenticate:
  - Provision a 32-char API key at `CAMERA_SERVICE_API_KEYS_PATH` (defaults to `/opt/camera-service/keys/api_keys.json`) and use it via `authenticate` then `auth_token` on protected calls.

### Execution Evidence (highlights)
- WebSocket API results (sample):
  - connect_ms: ~30.2; ping: ok (~0.48 ms); get_status: mediamtx healthy; get_camera_list: total=0, connected=0
- Ports: 8002 (service), 9997/8554/8888/8889 (MediaMTX) listening
- Processes: `python3 -m camera_service.main` (~36 MB RSS), `mediamtx` (~20 MB RSS)

### Conclusion
- Critical control plane workflows (service startup, WebSocket API, MediaMTX API connectivity, auth enforcement) are operational.
- Media plane workflows (camera discovery, streaming, recording, snapshots) remain UNTESTED in this run due to lack of devices and credentials.
- Next step: provision valid API credentials and use the substitution strategy (FFmpeg test source) to complete end-to-end camera lifecycle validation, or test with real USB cameras.
