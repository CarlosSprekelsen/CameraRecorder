# MediaMTX Camera Service - Unit Test Runner
# Purpose: Run unit tests with accurate coverage measurement per module
# Usage: ./tests/tools/run_unit_tests.sh
# 
# Follows Go Testing Guide: docs/testing/go-testing-guide.md
# - External testing (package *_test) with proper build tags
# - Cross-package coverage with -coverpkg flag
# - Real system testing over mocking
# - Proper environment sourcing
