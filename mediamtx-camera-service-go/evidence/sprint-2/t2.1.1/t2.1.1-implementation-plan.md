PLANNING FOR STORY S2.1: V4L2 CAMERA INTERFACE
PLAN OVERVIEW
OBJECTIVE:
Implement V4L2 camera interface with 100% functional equivalence to Python system, achieving <200ms latency for camera detection while maintaining strict compliance with project guidelines.
SCOPE DEFINITION:
Core V4L2 Interface Components:
Device Enumeration - Scan /dev/video* devices with capability detection
Camera Capability Probing - Query device formats, resolutions, frame rates
Device Status Monitoring - Real-time device availability and health checks
Configuration Integration - Use existing config system from Epic E1
Integration Points:
Configuration Management System (from S1.1) - Camera settings, polling intervals
Logging Infrastructure (from S1.2) - Structured logging with correlation IDs
Security Framework (from S1.3) - Role-based access to camera operations
TECHNICAL APPROACH:
V4L2 Implementation Strategy:
Native Go V4L2 bindings - Direct syscalls for performance
Device polling with configurable intervals - From config system
Capability caching - Reduce repeated device queries
Thread-safe device management - Concurrent access support
Performance Targets:
Camera detection latency: <200ms per device
Capability probing: <100ms per device
Status monitoring: <50ms per check
Memory usage: <10MB for 10 cameras
TESTING STRATEGY:
Unit Test Coverage Requirements:
95%+ line coverage for V4L2 interface
90%+ branch coverage for error handling
Performance benchmarks for latency validation
Integration tests with config system
Test Categories:
Device Enumeration Tests - Mock /dev/video* devices
Capability Probing Tests - Mock V4L2 ioctl responses
Status Monitoring Tests - Device availability scenarios
Configuration Integration Tests - Config-driven behavior
Performance Tests - Latency and throughput validation
CONTROL POINTS:
Phase 1: Core Implementation
Control Point 1.1: V4L2 device enumeration working
Control Point 1.2: Camera capability probing implemented
Control Point 1.3: Device status monitoring functional
Phase 2: Testing & Validation
Control Point 2.1: Unit tests achieving 95%+ coverage
Control Point 2.2: Performance benchmarks meeting <200ms target
Control Point 2.3: Integration tests with config system passing
Phase 3: Integration & Architecture
Control Point 3.1: Configuration system integration complete
Control Point 3.2: Architectural compliance validated
Control Point 3.3: Performance targets met consistently
RISK MITIGATION:
Technical Risks:
V4L2 complexity - Use proven Go V4L2 libraries
Performance bottlenecks - Implement caching and optimization
Device compatibility - Test with multiple camera types
Integration Risks:
Config system dependencies - Ensure proper integration
