# Current Status - WebSocket Binding Issue

**Date:** August 7, 2025  
**Issue:** WebSocket server not binding to port 8002  
**Status:** Install script path issues fixed, ready for testing  

---

## What Was Fixed

1. **Python Import Paths** - Fixed absolute imports to relative imports
2. **Configuration Schema** - Fixed camera-service.yaml parameters
3. **Install Script** - Fixed path issues:
   - Added MediaMTX config directory creation
   - Fixed directory navigation (save/restore original directory)
   - Fixed PROJECT_ROOT calculation
   - Removed duplicate source code copying
4. **Uninstall Script** - Created comprehensive uninstall script

---

## Path Issues Fixed

**Problem:** Script was changing directory to `/opt/mediamtx` and not returning, causing path resolution issues.

**Fixes applied:**
- Save original directory before MediaMTX installation
- Return to original directory after MediaMTX installation
- Fixed PROJECT_ROOT calculation from `$(dirname "$(dirname "$SCRIPT_DIR")")` to `$(dirname "$SCRIPT_DIR")`
- Removed duplicate source code copying section

---

## What Needs to Be Done

### **Immediate Action Required**
```bash
# Test the fixed install script
sudo deployment/scripts/install.sh

# If successful, test WebSocket binding
netstat -tlnp | grep 8002
curl http://localhost:8003/health/ready
```
