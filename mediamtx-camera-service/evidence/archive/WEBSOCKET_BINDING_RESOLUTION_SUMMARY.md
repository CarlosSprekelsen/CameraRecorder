# WebSocket Binding Issue - Complete Resolution Summary

**Date:** August 7, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority:** High  
**Impact:** Service unavailable for ~1 hour  

---

## Issue Summary

The MediaMTX Camera Service WebSocket server was not binding to port 8002, preventing client connections. The issue was caused by multiple configuration and import path problems that were not caught during development and testing phases.

### **Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Python Module Import Path Problems** - Service used absolute imports instead of relative imports
2. **Configuration Schema Mismatches** - Configuration file parameters didn't match expected schema
3. **Missing Directory Permissions** - Installation script didn't create required directories
4. **Service Configuration Issues** - Systemd service had incorrect module path

---

## Resolution Actions Completed

### **✅ Technical Fixes Applied**

#### **1. Python Import Path Corrections**
**Files Fixed:**
- `src/camera_service/service_manager.py`
- `src/camera_service/logging_config.py`
- `src/mediamtx_wrapper/controller.py`
- `src/websocket_server/server.py`

**Changes:**
```python
# Before (absolute imports)
from mediamtx_wrapper.controller import MediaMTXController
from camera_service.logging_config import set_correlation_id

# After (relative imports)
from ..mediamtx_wrapper.controller import MediaMTXController
from ..camera_service.logging_config import set_correlation_id
```

#### **2. Configuration Schema Corrections**
**File:** `config/camera-service.yaml`

**Changes:**
```yaml
# Before
mediamtx:
  api_url: "http://localhost:9997"
  api_timeout: 30

# After
mediamtx:
  host: "localhost"
  api_port: 9997
```

#### **3. Service Configuration Fix**
**File:** `deployment/scripts/install.sh`

**Changes:**
```bash
# Before
ExecStart=/opt/camera-service/venv/bin/python -m src.camera_service

# After
ExecStart=/opt/camera-service/venv/bin/python -m src.camera_service.main
```

#### **4. Directory Creation and Permissions**
**Added to installation script:**
```bash
mkdir -p /var/recordings /var/snapshots
chown camera-service:camera-service /var/recordings /var/snapshots
chmod 755 /var/recordings /var/snapshots
```

## Why This Was Not Caught in Original Tests

### **1. Environment Differences**
- **Development:** Tests run from project root with `PYTHONPATH` set
- **Production:** Service runs from `/opt/camera-service` with different Python path
- **Gap:** No production-like environment testing

### **2. Configuration Testing Gaps**
- **Unit Tests:** Test individual components with mocked configurations
- **Integration Tests:** Test component interactions but not production config files
- **Gap:** No validation of actual configuration file schema

### **3. Installation Testing Gaps**
- **Current Tests:** Test service functionality but not installation process
- **Missing:** Installation validation, directory creation, permission setup
- **Gap:** No end-to-end installation testing

### **4. Service Lifecycle Testing Gaps**
- **Current Tests:** Test service components but not systemd service startup
- **Missing:** Service startup validation, WebSocket binding verification
- **Gap:** No production service lifecycle testing
