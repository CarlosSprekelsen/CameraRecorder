# PDR Entry Baseline - No-Mock Enforcement Implementation

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Role:** Project Manager  
**PDR Phase:** Entry Baseline  
**Status:** Final  

## Executive Summary

PDR entry baseline has been established with comprehensive no-mock enforcement technically implemented. The baseline ensures that all PDR, integration, and IVV tests execute against real system components without any mocking, validating design implementability through actual system behavior.

## No-Mock Test Execution Summary

### Technical Implementation Status

✅ **Enhanced conftest.py Configuration**
- Comprehensive no-mock guard implemented for `FORBID_MOCKS=1` environment
- Blocks all common mocking libraries: unittest.mock, pytest-mock, freezegun, responses, httpretty, requests_mock, factory_boy, faker, mimesis
- Automatic marker assignment for PDR, integration, and IVV tests
- Enforcement of no-mock requirement for PDR-scope tests

✅ **Pytest Configuration**
- Added `pdr` marker to pytest.ini
- Configured test paths for PDR, integration, and IVV test execution
- Strict marker enforcement enabled

✅ **Real System Validation Fixtures**
- `pdr_test_environment` fixture for PDR-specific configuration
- `real_system_validator` fixture for component validation without mocking
- Enhanced test environment configuration for real system testing

### No-Mock Enforcement Checklist

**Technical Implementation:**
- ✅ `tests/conftest.py` contains comprehensive no-mock runtime guard
- ✅ `pytest.ini` defines markers: pdr, integration, ivv
- ✅ CI-ready configuration for: `FORBID_MOCKS=1 pytest -m "integration or ivv or pdr" -q`
- ✅ Static analysis prevents mock imports in integration/ivv/pdr directories

**Test Execution:**
- ✅ All PDR tests require `FORBID_MOCKS=1` environment variable
- ✅ Real system integrations operational for all testing
- ✅ External system mocks require documented waivers with PM approval

## Real System Evidence

### Baseline Configuration

**Test Environment:**
- Host: 127.0.0.1 (IP-based for reliability)
- API Port: 9997
- RTSP Port: 8554
- WebRTC Port: 8889
- HLS Port: 8888
- WebSocket Port: 8002
- Health Port: 8003

**Real System Components:**
- Camera Service Manager (real implementation)
- MediaMTX Controller (real wrapper)
- WebSocket JSON-RPC Server (real implementation)
- Hybrid Camera Monitor (real implementation)
- Configuration Management (real implementation)

### No-Mock Validation Framework

**RealSystemValidator Class:**
- Component-by-component validation without mocking
- Real system behavior testing
- Actual error condition validation
- Performance measurement against real components

## Implementation Validation

### PDR Scope Boundaries

**✅ Included in PDR Baseline:**
- Critical prototypes proving implementability
- Interface contract testing against real endpoints
- Basic performance sanity (not full compliance)
- Security design validation (not penetration testing)
- No-mock CI integration

**❌ Excluded from PDR Scope:**
- Full load/stress testing (CDR scope)
- Operational readiness (ORR scope)
- Deployment automation (CDR scope)
- System-wide performance compliance (CDR scope)

### Technical Guardrails

**No-Mock Enforcement:**
- Runtime prevention of mock imports when `FORBID_MOCKS=1`
- Automatic test skipping for PDR/Integration/IVV tests without proper environment
- Comprehensive library blocking for all common mocking frameworks
- Real system validation fixtures for component testing

**Quality Gates:**
- All PDR tests must pass with `FORBID_MOCKS=1`
- Real system integration validation required
- Component interface contract verification
- Basic performance sanity confirmation

## Conclusion

PDR entry baseline has been successfully established with comprehensive no-mock enforcement technically implemented. The baseline provides:

1. **Technical Foundation**: Enhanced conftest.py with comprehensive no-mock guards
2. **Test Framework**: PDR-specific markers and fixtures for real system validation
3. **Quality Assurance**: Automatic enforcement of no-mock requirements for PDR-scope tests
4. **Evidence Framework**: Real system validation capabilities for design implementability

The baseline is ready for PDR test execution with `FORBID_MOCKS=1` environment variable, ensuring all validation occurs against real system components without any mocking.

**Next Steps:**
- Execute PDR test suite with `FORBID_MOCKS=1 pytest -m "pdr or integration or ivv" -v`
- Validate design implementability through real system execution
- Document any external system mock waivers with PM approval
- Prepare for PDR completion baseline
