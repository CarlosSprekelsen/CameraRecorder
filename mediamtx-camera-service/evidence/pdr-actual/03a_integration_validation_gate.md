   - No mock substitutions detected

2. **WebSocket Server Integration** ✅

### Real System Status Verification

#### MediaMTX Service Status
```bash
# Process Status
mediamtx 3517790  1.6  0.3 1249928 30596 ?       Ssl  06:22   7:42 /opt/mediamtx/mediamtx /opt/mediamtx/config/mediamtx.yml

# API Accessibility
curl -s http://localhost:9997/v3/config/global/get
# Result: ✅ Live MediaMTX API responding with configuration data
```

#### No-Mock Verification
```bash
# Verify no mocking in core PDR tests
grep -r "mock\|Mock\|patch" tests/pdr/test_mediamtx_interface_contracts.py tests/pdr/test_performance_sanity.py tests/pdr/test_security_design_validation.py
# Result: No output = No mocking found

# Verify real system components
grep -r "MediaMTXController\|ServiceManager\|WebSocketJsonRpcServer\|JWTHandler\|APIKeyHandler" tests/pdr/test_mediamtx_interface_contracts.py tests/pdr/test_performance_sanity.py tests/pdr/test_security_design_validation.py
