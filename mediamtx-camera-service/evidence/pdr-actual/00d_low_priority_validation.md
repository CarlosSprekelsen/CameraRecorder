**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Role:** IV&V  
**PDR Phase:** Extended Remediation - Low Priority Gap Validation  
**Status:** Completed  

## Executive Summary

IV&V has completed validation of all low priority gap fixes through independent no-mock testing. Performance metrics, logging, and error handling are fully operational and validated.
