# Final Remediation Verification: Baseline Certification

**Date**: 2025-08-13  
**Reviewer**: IV&V Team  
**Purpose**: Final verification of critical implementation gap resolution for baseline certification  
**Authority**: IV&V must certify BASELINE READY before PM gate review

## Executive Summary

Significant remediation progress verified. IV&V tests pass 100%. Performance validation passes. However, WebSocket server is not listening on required ports, and 2 contract tests still fail. Baseline certification cannot be granted.

## Verification Scope and Results

### 1) Full IV&V test suite (no-mock)

Command:
```bash
FORBID_MOCKS=1 python3 -m pytest -m "ivv" tests/ivv/ -v --tb=short
```
Result:
```text
30 passed, 6 warnings in 30.00s
```
Assessment: PASSED (100%)

### 2) WebSocket server operational (ports 8000/8002)

Command:
```bash
netstat -tlnp 2>/dev/null | grep -E "(8000|8002)" || echo "NO_WS_PORTS"
```
Result:
```text
NO_WS_PORTS
```
Assessment: FAILED (WebSocket not listening on 8000/8002)

### 3) Performance validation

Command:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/performance/ -v --tb=short
```
Result:
```text
1 passed in 0.41s
```
Assessment: PASSED (100%)

### 4) Contract tests (integration)

Command:
```bash
FORBID_MOCKS=1 python3 -m pytest -m "integration" tests/contracts/ -v --tb=short
```
Result:
```text
3 passed, 2 failed, 5 warnings in 10.41s
Failures: test_data_structure_contracts_validation, test_comprehensive_contract_validation
```
Assessment: FAILED (60%)

## Baseline Certification Criteria Evaluation

- **Test success rate**: Target >95%
  - IV&V: 30/30 = 100%
  - Contracts: 3/5 = 60%
  - Performance: 1/1 = 100%
  - Overall: 34/36 = 94.4%  → NOT MET
- **Configuration errors**: Target 0  → MET (0)
- **Critical failures**: Target 0  → NOT MET (3 outstanding: WebSocket operational failure + 2 contract failures)
- **API endpoints**: 100% operational (WebSocket + existing)  → NOT MET (WebSocket not listening)
- **Real system integration**: Fully functional  → PARTIAL (MediaMTX and devices OK; WebSocket not operational)

## Endpoint Verification Details

- WebSocket server: NOT LISTENING on 8000/8002
- MediaMTX: Operational (API reachable previously; RTSP 8554 and API 9997 listening)
- Camera devices: Present (4 devices detected)

## Implementation Gap Analysis

Resolved:
- Configuration system (0 errors)  
- MediaMTX integration (operational)  
- Camera device integration (devices present and tests pass)  
- Performance validation (passes)

Outstanding (Critical):
- WebSocket server startup: Not listening on required ports (8000/8002)
- Contract test failures: Data structure and comprehensive validation failing (2 tests)

## Certification Decision

- Decision: CONTINUE REMEDIATION
- Rationale:
  - Overall success rate 94.4% (<95% threshold)
  - 2 contract test failures remain
  - WebSocket server not operational on required ports
  - Real system integrations otherwise functional

## Required Remediations (Blocking)

1) WebSocket server
- Ensure server binds to 0.0.0.0:8002 (per config) and/or 127.0.0.1:8000 if required by contracts
- Add startup health check and fail-fast logging if bind fails

2) Contract test fixes
- Fix get_camera_status and related structures to satisfy data structure contract
- Ensure camera monitor availability or return compliant fallbacks for get_camera_list/get_streams in absence of hardware

3) Re-run certification checks
- Re-run full IV&V, contracts, performance
- Verify ports 8000/8002 are listening

## Summary of Results

- IV&V tests: PASSED (30/30)
- Performance tests: PASSED (1/1)
- Contract tests: FAILED (3/5 pass)
- WebSocket endpoints: FAILED (not listening on 8000/8002)
- Certification: CONTINUE REMEDIATION
