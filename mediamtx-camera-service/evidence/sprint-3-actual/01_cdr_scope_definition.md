# Comprehensive CDR Execution Plan - Complete System Validation

## CDR Philosophy: Working Software Priority

**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:** Prove the MediaMTX Camera Service works through actual execution, testing, and demonstration. Documentation captures execution results as evidence, but **WORKING SOFTWARE IS THE PRIORITY**.

**Execution-First Approach:**
- ACTUALLY START and test the system
- ACTUALLY RUN all test suites and analyze real results  
- ACTUALLY EXECUTE functional scenarios and measure performance
- ACTUALLY PERFORM security testing and deployment validation
- Documentation records REAL EXECUTION RESULTS, not theoretical assessments

## CDR Scope Definition

**Critical Design Review Objective:** Comprehensive validation of MediaMTX Camera Service production readiness across ALL dimensions:
- Complete requirements coverage (all F1.x, F2.x, F3.x requirements)
- Architecture implementation validation (all components and architecture decisions)
- System integration and functionality verification
- All test layer validation (unit, integration, system, security)
- Production deployment readiness assessment
- Performance, security, and operational readiness
- Complete documentation and maintainability validation
