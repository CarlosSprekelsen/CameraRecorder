# Phase 1 Remediation Implementation â€“ Security Enforcement and Performance Framework

Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-08-09
Prepared by: Development Team
Status: Submitted to IV&V for Phase 1 remediation validation

## Security Enforcement Implementation
- Enabled strict authentication/authorization for protected JSON-RPC methods (`take_snapshot`, `start_recording`, `stop_recording`).
- Implemented `authenticate` JSON-RPC method to register tokens per-connection.
- Enforced role-based authorization (operator) for protected methods.
- Integrated security middleware (`SecurityMiddleware`) via `ServiceManager` to wire `JWTHandler`, `APIKeyHandler`, and `AuthManager`.
- Authentication failure returns JSON-RPC error `-32001`; insufficient permissions returns `-32003`.

## Performance Framework Implementation
- Added per-method performance metrics in WebSocket server: count, avg_ms, max_ms, last_ms.
- Exposed `get_metrics` JSON-RPC method for metrics retrieval.
- Rate limiting integrated via `SecurityMiddleware` with configurable limits.
- Baseline collection planned via CI job invoking `get_metrics` after synthetic load.

## Validation Test Results

### Authentication Enforcement
- Invalid token case (JWT):
```
Request: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"start_recording","params":{"device":"/dev/video0","duration_seconds":2,"auth_token":"invalid"}}
Response: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32001,"message":"Authentication failed: Invalid authentication token"},"id":1}
```
- Missing token case (JWT):
```
Request: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"take_snapshot","params":{"device":"/dev/video0"}}
Response: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32001,"message":"Authentication required - call authenticate or provide auth_token"},"id":2}
```
- Insufficient role case (viewer attempting):
```
Request: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"start_recording","params":{"device":"/dev/video0","auth_token":"<viewer_token>"}}
Response: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32003,"message":"Insufficient permissions - operator role required"},"id":3}
```

### Performance Metrics
- After 50 ping calls and 10 `get_camera_list` calls:
```
Request: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":10,"method":"get_metrics"}
Response: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"methods":{"ping":{"count":50,"avg_ms":1.2,"max_ms":3.5,"last_ms":1.1},"get_camera_list":{"count":10,"avg_ms":12.8,"max_ms":20.4,"last_ms":13.0}}},"id":10}
```
- Rate limiting verification:
```
Excess requests -> Response error: {"code":-32002,"message":"Rate limit exceeded"}
```

## Configuration Changes
- Security middleware is initialized in `ServiceManager` with:
  - JWT secret: environment variable `CAMERA_SERVICE_JWT_SECRET` (fallback dev secret, change for production)
  - API keys storage: `/opt/camera-service/keys/api_keys.json` (configurable via `CAMERA_SERVICE_API_KEYS_PATH`)
  - Requests per minute: configurable via `CAMERA_SERVICE_RATE_RPM` (default 120)
- Production security enforcement requires:
  - Set strong `CAMERA_SERVICE_JWT_SECRET`
  - Enable WSS/TLS termination (per deployment docs)
  - Provision operator-role JWTs or API keys

## Production Readiness Updates
- Security:
  - Strict enforcement enabled for protected methods; negative tests pass (reject invalid/expired/missing tokens).
  - Authorization role check enforced (operator required).
- Performance:
  - Metrics available via `get_metrics`; baseline to be collected in CI and compared to thresholds (N1.x).
  - Rate limiting active to mitigate abuse.
