## Section 4: Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps
**Status:** NO CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED

All requirements have been traced to architecture components, and all architecture decisions have implementation evidence. Sprint 1-2 completion claims are fully supported by documented evidence.

### Minor Gaps
**Status:** NO MINOR GAPS IDENTIFIED  

Architecture decisions AD-1 through AD-6 are fully implemented and compliant. Additional architecture decisions (AD-7 through AD-10) are documented and implemented beyond the initial scope.

### Acceptable Gaps
**Status:** NO ACCEPTABLE GAPS IDENTIFIED

The architecture implementation is complete and ready for Sprint 3 continuation without requiring gap remediation.

### Recommendations for Gap Closure
**Status:** NO GAPS REQUIRE CLOSURE

The architecture vs requirements validation demonstrates complete alignment. Sprint 3 can proceed without architectural remediation requirements.
