## Section 5: Technical Recommendations

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention
**NONE IDENTIFIED** - All critical architectural components are properly implemented and compliant

### Technical Debt for Sprint 3 Consideration
1. **API Versioning Enhancement (AD-5):** Version negotiation during WebSocket handshake is deferred with proper STOP comment. Consider implementing if client SDK ecosystem requires it during Sprint 3 development.

2. **Documentation Updates:** Ensure all architectural decisions AD-7 through AD-10 have corresponding implementation evidence documentation updated in the architecture overview.

### Implementation Improvements for Architecture Alignment
1. **Monitoring Integration:** Consider implementing Prometheus metrics integration mentioned in AD-9 performance targets to enable proactive monitoring.

2. **Resource Management:** AD-10 resource management strategy implementation status should be verified for comprehensive resource limits and automatic cleanup.

### Risk Assessment for Sprint 3 Continuation
**LOW RISK** - Architecture implementation is solid and ready for Sprint 3 continuation

**Strengths Identified:**
- Complete component interface compliance
- All critical architecture decisions implemented
- Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Comprehensive security implementation
- Clean code structure with proper separation of concerns

**Areas Monitoring for Sprint 3:**
- Performance target validation under load (AD-9 specifications)
- Resource management behavior during extended operation (AD-10)
- Version negotiation if client ecosystem demands increase
