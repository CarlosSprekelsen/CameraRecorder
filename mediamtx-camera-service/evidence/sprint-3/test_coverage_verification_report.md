## Section 5: Coverage Gaps

### Major Coverage Deficiencies

**BLOCKER: Test Execution Failure**
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - No test coverage can be measured
- **Root Cause:** Tests hang during execution (infinite loops or blocking operations)
- **Risk:** CRITICAL - Cannot validate any system functionality

**1. Service Manager Module (UNKNOWN coverage)**
- **Impact:** Critical - orchestrates all system components
- **Missing:** Cannot determine - tests hang during execution
- **Risk:** Critical - core system functionality unvalidated

**2. MediaMTX Controller (UNKNOWN coverage)**
- **Impact:** Critical - manages media streaming and recording
- **Missing:** Cannot determine - tests hang during execution
- **Risk:** Critical - core media functionality unvalidated

**3. Security Modules (UNKNOWN coverage)**
- **Impact:** Critical - authentication and authorization
- **Missing:** Cannot determine - tests hang during execution
- **Risk:** Critical - security vulnerabilities unvalidated

**4. WebSocket Server (UNKNOWN coverage)**
- **Impact:** Critical - real-time communication interface
- **Missing:** Cannot determine - tests hang during execution
- **Risk:** Critical - client communication unvalidated

### Missing Edge Case Coverage
- Error recovery and resilience testing
- Boundary condition testing
- Performance and load testing
- Security vulnerability testing
- Integration failure scenarios

### Insufficient Integration Coverage
- End-to-end workflow validation
- Component interaction testing
- Real vs mocked component testing
- Cross-module error propagation

## Recommendations for Coverage Improvement

### Immediate Actions (Sprint 3 Priority)
1. **Resolve test execution issues** - Investigate and fix hanging tests
2. **Implement service manager tests** - Critical path coverage
3. **Add MediaMTX controller tests** - Core functionality validation
4. **Develop security module tests** - Authentication and authorization
5. **Create WebSocket server tests** - Communication interface validation

### Medium-term Improvements
1. **Establish test execution pipeline** - Automated CI/CD integration
2. **Implement integration test suite** - End-to-end validation
3. **Add performance and load testing** - Scalability validation
4. **Develop security testing framework** - Vulnerability assessment

### Long-term Enhancements
1. **Comprehensive error recovery testing** - Resilience validation
2. **Cross-component integration testing** - System-wide validation
3. **Automated test coverage monitoring** - Continuous quality assurance

| All critical paths covered | ❌ BLOCKED | Tests hang during execution |
| S5 integration tests pass | ❌ BLOCKED | Tests hang during execution |
| Test reliability >95% | ❌ BLOCKED | 0% success rate due to hanging |

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Service Manager (0% coverage)** - Core orchestration untested
2. **MediaMTX Controller (0% coverage)** - Media functionality untested
3. **Security Modules (0% coverage)** - Authentication untested
4. **WebSocket Server (0% coverage)** - Communication untested

### Medium Risk Areas
1. **Error Recovery (0% coverage)** - Resilience untested
2. **Integration Scenarios (0% coverage)** - End-to-end untested
3. **Performance (0% coverage)** - Scalability untested

### Mitigation Recommendations
1. **Immediate:** Focus on critical path testing in Sprint 3
2. **Short-term:** Establish reliable test execution pipeline
3. **Medium-term:** Implement comprehensive integration testing

## Conclusion

The current test coverage for Sprint 1-2 deliverables is **BLOCKED** due to test execution failures. No quantitative coverage data can be obtained because tests hang during execution, preventing any meaningful validation of system functionality.

**Key Findings:**
- **CRITICAL BLOCKER:** Tests hang during execution (infinite loops or blocking operations)
- **No coverage data available** - Cannot measure any coverage percentage
- **No critical path validation** - Cannot verify any system functionality
- **Test infrastructure compromised** - Execution pipeline non-functional

**Recommendation:** **BLOCK SPRINT 3** until test execution issues are resolved. The current state prevents any meaningful validation of Sprint 1-2 deliverables.

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **CRITICAL:** Investigate and resolve test hanging issues
2. **CRITICAL:** Establish functional test execution pipeline
3. **CRITICAL:** Achieve at least one complete test run
4. **CRITICAL:** Re-validate coverage before any Sprint 3 work

**Risk Level:** **CRITICAL** - No system validation possible in current state
