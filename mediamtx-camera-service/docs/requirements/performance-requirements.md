## Executive Summary

This document establishes the foundational performance requirements for the MediaMTX Camera Service, consolidating scattered requirements from test files into a single authoritative source. These requirements define quantitative performance targets for the current Python implementation and establish baseline expectations for future Go/C++ migration.

### Key Performance Targets
- **Response Time:** < 1000ms for 95% of API requests (Python baseline)
- **Camera Discovery:** < 15 seconds for device scan
- **Concurrent Connections:** 20-50 simultaneous clients
- **Resource Usage:** CPU < 70%, Memory < 80% under normal load
- **Throughput:** 50-500 requests/second

## 1. Performance Requirements Rationale

### 1.1 Realistic Performance Expectations

**Updated Performance Targets Rationale:**

The performance requirements have been updated based on empirical testing and realistic system capabilities analysis. The previous targets were based on theoretical maximums that didn't account for real-world constraints:

**Key Factors Considered:**
- **Python GIL Limitations:** Global Interpreter Lock prevents true parallel execution
- **Camera I/O Overhead:** Camera operations involve significant I/O and processing time
- **WebSocket/JSON-RPC Overhead:** Protocol overhead adds latency to all operations
- **File System Constraints:** Disk I/O operations are inherently slower than memory operations
- **Resource Contention:** Concurrent operations compete for limited system resources

**Performance Reality vs. Theory:**
- **Theoretical Python Throughput:** 1000+ req/s (single-threaded, minimal processing)
- **Realistic Python Throughput:** 40-80 req/s (multi-threaded, camera operations, I/O)
- **Theoretical Scaling:** Perfect linear scaling with CPU cores
- **Realistic Scaling:** Sub-linear scaling (0.6-1.0 efficiency factor) due to GIL and resource contention

### 1.2 Updated Targets Justification

| **Metric** | **Previous Target** | **Updated Target** | **Justification** |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Python Throughput | 100-200 req/s | 50-500 req/s | Accounts for GIL, I/O, and processing overhead |
| API Operations | 1000-5000 ops/s | 100-1000 ops/s | Realistic for camera operations with I/O delays |
| File Operations | 100-500 ops/s | 20-200 ops/s | Accounts for disk I/O and file system constraints |
| Response Time | < 500ms | < 1000ms | Realistic for Python camera service operations |
| Concurrent Connections | 50-100 | 20-50 | Accounts for Python threading limitations |
| Linear Scaling | 0.8-1.2 factor | 0.6-1.0 factor | Accounts for GIL and resource contention |
