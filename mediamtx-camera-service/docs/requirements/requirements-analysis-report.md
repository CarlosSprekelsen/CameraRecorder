## 8. Conclusion

The updated requirements baseline shows significant improvement over previous versions, with comprehensive coverage across all major system components. However, several critical gaps and quality issues remain that require immediate attention:

1. **Security gaps** pose the highest risk and should be addressed immediately
2. **Duplications** create maintenance burden and should be consolidated
3. **Vague requirements** need specific acceptance criteria for proper validation
4. **Missing operational requirements** should be added for complete coverage

The recommended implementation roadmap will improve the baseline quality from 72% to 88% while reducing the total requirement count by 9%, creating a more maintainable and testable requirements foundation.

**Next Steps:** Begin Phase 1 implementation immediately, focusing on security requirements and authentication consolidation.
