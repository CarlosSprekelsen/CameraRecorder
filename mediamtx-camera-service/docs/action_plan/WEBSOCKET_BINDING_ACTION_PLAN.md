---

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### **1. Python Module Import Path Problems** ✅ RESOLVED

**Root Cause:** Service installed with absolute imports instead of relative imports
**Files Fixed:**
- `src/camera_service/service_manager.py` - Fixed `mediamtx_wrapper` and `camera_discovery` imports
- `src/camera_service/logging_config.py` - Fixed `camera_service.config` import
- `src/mediamtx_wrapper/controller.py` - Fixed `camera_service.logging_config` import
- `src/websocket_server/server.py` - Fixed `camera_service.logging_config` import

**Changes Made:**
```python
# Before (absolute imports)
from mediamtx_wrapper.controller import MediaMTXController
from camera_service.logging_config import set_correlation_id

# After (relative imports)
from ..mediamtx_wrapper.controller import MediaMTXController
from ..camera_service.logging_config import set_correlation_id
```

### **2. Configuration Schema Mismatches** ✅ RESOLVED

**Root Cause:** Configuration file parameters didn't match expected schema
**File Fixed:** `config/camera-service.yaml`

**Changes Made:**
```yaml
# Before
mediamtx:
  api_url: "http://localhost:9997"
  api_timeout: 30

logging:
  file: "/var/log/camera-service/camera-service.log"
  max_size: "10MB"

# After
mediamtx:
  host: "localhost"
  api_port: 9997

logging:
  file_enabled: true
  file_path: "/var/log/camera-service/camera-service.log"
  max_file_size: "10MB"
```

### **3. Service Configuration Issues** ✅ RESOLVED

**Root Cause:** Systemd service configuration had incorrect module path
**File Fixed:** `deployment/scripts/install.sh`

**Changes Made:**
```bash
# Before
ExecStart=/opt/camera-service/venv/bin/python -m src.camera_service

# After
ExecStart=/opt/camera-service/venv/bin/python -m src.camera_service.main
```

### **4. Missing Directory Permissions** ✅ RESOLVED

**Root Cause:** Installation script didn't create required directories with proper permissions
**File Fixed:** `deployment/scripts/install.sh`

**Changes Made:**
```bash
# Added to installation script
mkdir -p /var/recordings /var/snapshots
chown camera-service:camera-service /var/recordings /var/snapshots
chmod 755 /var/recordings /var/snapshots
```

## New Testing Infrastructure

### **1. Installation Validation Tests** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**File:** `tests/installation/test_installation_validation.py`

**Test Coverage:**
- Directory creation and permissions validation
- Service startup and binding verification
- Configuration file validation
- Python import testing in production environment
- WebSocket server accessibility testing
- Health endpoint validation
- MediaMTX integration testing
- Service log analysis
- File permission validation
- Service dependency verification

**Key Features:**
- Production-like environment testing
- Real service lifecycle validation
- Configuration schema validation
- Error detection and reporting

### **2. Pre-Deployment Validation Script** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**File:** `scripts/validate_deployment.sh`

**Validation Functions:**
- `validate_directory_permissions()` - Checks directory existence and permissions
- `validate_service_user()` - Verifies service user access rights
- `validate_configuration()` - Validates configuration file schema
- `validate_python_imports()` - Tests Python imports in production environment
- `validate_service_configuration()` - Checks systemd service configuration
- `validate_service_startup()` - Verifies service startup capability
- `validate_websocket_binding()` - Confirms WebSocket server binding
- `validate_health_endpoint()` - Tests health endpoint accessibility
- `validate_mediamtx_integration()` - Verifies MediaMTX integration
- `validate_service_logs()` - Analyzes service logs for errors
- `validate_dependencies()` - Checks required system dependencies

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run pre-deployment validation
./scripts/validate_deployment.sh

# Expected output: All validations passed
```
