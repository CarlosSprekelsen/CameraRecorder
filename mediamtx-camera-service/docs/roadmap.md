## Work Breakdown & Current Status

### E1: Robust Real-Time Camera Service Core - âœ… COMPLETE

- **S1a: Architecture Scaffolding (COMPLETE)**  
    - Status: âœ… Complete  
    - Summary: API contracts, configuration structures, method/handler stubs, and documentation frameworks are in place and aligned with the approved architecture.  

- **S2: Architecture Compliance IV&V (Control Point) - COMPLETE**  
    - Status: âœ… Complete  
    - Summary: Stubs and scaffolding validated against architecture; no accidental scope creep; coding standards and docstring requirements confirmed.  
    - Evidence Sources: `docs/architecture/overview.md`, `docs/development/principles.md`, audit artifacts.

- **S2b: Fast-Track Audit Baseline (Informational)**  
    - Status: âœ… Completed / Baseline Captured  
    - Purpose: Capture the actual implementation state from fast-track work to feed into S3/S4 closure. Not a blocking gate if clarifications remain; findings were folded into subsequent stories.  
    - Audit Artifacts: `WebSocket Server Code Audit.md`, `MediaMTX Controller Code Audit.md`, `Camera Service Manager Audit.md`, `Camera Discovery Module Security Audit.md`  
    - Summary Findings: Core modules largely implemented; remaining deficiencies identified around metadata confirmation, observability, health recovery logic, and test scaffolds.  

- **S3: Camera Discovery & Monitoring Implementation - COMPLETE**  
    - Status: âœ… Complete  
    - Summary: Service manager lifecycle, observability hardening, and comprehensive test coverage completed. Udev event processing, capability detection, and metadata reconciliation validated.
    - Evidence: Test suite completion (2025-08-05), `src/camera_service/service_manager.py` (lines 650-750), `tests/unit/test_camera_service/test_service_manager_lifecycle.py`

- **S4: MediaMTX Integration - COMPLETE**  
    - Status: âœ… Complete  
    - Summary: Health monitor edge-case testing completed. Circuit breaker flapping resistance, recovery confirmation logic, and backoff/jitter behavior validated. Snapshot capture and recording duration implementation hardened.
    - Evidence: `src/mediamtx_wrapper/controller.py`, health monitoring test suite, decision log entries for snapshot/recording partials.

- **S5: Core Integration IV&V (Control Point)** - âœ… **COMPLETE**
  - Status: âœ… Complete
  - Summary: Real integration testing validates end-to-end functionality, component coordination, error recovery, and performance characteristics. Over-mocking concerns addressed with actual component validation.
  - Evidence: `tests/ivv/test_real_integration.py` (6 tests, 100% pass rate), real component testing artifacts (2025-08-05)

### E2: Security and Production Hardening - âœ… COMPLETE

    - Evidence: 71/71 security tests passing, comprehensive attack vector protection, performance benchmarks met.

- **S7: Security IV&V (Control Point)**  
    - Status: âœ… Complete
