# MediaMTX Camera Service - Development Roadmap

**Version:** 4.2  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-05  
**Status:** Active Development  

This roadmap defines the current development status, completed work, and prioritized backlog for the MediaMTX Camera Service project. All work follows the IV&V (Independent Verification & Validation) control points defined in the principles document.

---

## Work Breakdown & Current Status

### E1: Robust Real-Time Camera Service Core - SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE (FAST TRACK)

- **S1a: Architecture Scaffolding (COMPLETE)**  
    - Status: âœ… Complete  
    - Summary: API contracts, configuration structures, method/handler stubs, and documentation frameworks are in place and aligned with the approved architecture.  

- **S2: Architecture Compliance IV&V (Control Point) - COMPLETE**  
    - Status: âœ… Complete  
    - Summary: Stubs and scaffolding validated against architecture; no accidental scope creep; coding standards and docstring requirements confirmed.  
    - Evidence Sources: `docs/architecture/overview.md`, `docs/development/principles.md`, audit artifacts.

- **S2b: Fast-Track Audit Baseline (Informational)**  
    - Status: âœ… Completed / Baseline Captured  
    - Purpose: Capture the actual implementation state from fast-track work to feed into S3/S4 closure. Not a blocking gate if clarifications remain; findings were folded into subsequent stories.  
    - Audit Artifacts: `WebSocket Server Code Audit.md`, `MediaMTX Controller Code Audit.md`, `Camera Service Manager Audit.md`, `Camera Discovery Module Security Audit.md`  
    - Summary Findings: Core modules largely implemented; remaining deficiencies identified around metadata confirmation, observability, health recovery logic, and test scaffolds.  

- **S3: Camera Discovery & Monitoring Implementation - COMPLETE**  
    - Status: âœ… Complete  
    - Summary: Service manager lifecycle, observability hardening, and comprehensive test coverage completed. Udev event processing, capability detection, and metadata reconciliation validated.
    - Evidence: Test suite completion (2025-08-05), `src/camera_service/service_manager.py` (lines 650-750), `tests/unit/test_camera_service/test_service_manager_lifecycle.py`

- **S4: MediaMTX Integration - COMPLETE**  
    - Status: âœ… Complete  
    - Summary: Health monitor edge-case testing completed. Circuit breaker flapping resistance, recovery confirmation logic, and backoff/jitter behavior validated. Snapshot capture and recording duration implementation hardened.
    - Evidence: `src/mediamtx_wrapper/controller.py`, health monitoring test suite, decision log entries for snapshot/recording partials.

- **S5: Core Integration IV&V (Control Point)** - âœ… **COMPLETE**
  - Status: âœ… Complete
  - Summary: Real integration testing validates end-to-end functionality, component coordination, error recovery, and performance characteristics. Over-mocking concerns addressed with actual component validation.
  - Evidence: `tests/ivv/test_real_integration.py` (6 tests, 100% pass rate), real component testing artifacts (2025-08-05)

### E2: Security and Production Hardening - PENDING E1 COMPLETION

- **S7: Security IV&V (Control Point)**  
    - Status: â¬œ Pending  
    - Gate: Authentication/authorization, access control, security test cases must be reviewed and passing before proceeding to E3.  

### E3: Client API & SDK Ecosystem - PENDING E2 COMPLETION

- **S8: Client APIs and Examples**  
    - Status: â¬œ Pending  
    - Tasks: Add client usage examples, document authentication/usage, create SDKs.  

- **S9: SDK & Docs IV&V (Control Point)**  
    - Status: â¬œ Pending  
    - Gate: Review docs/examples for accuracy, usability testing.  

### E4: Future Extensibility - PLANNING ONLY

- **S10: Cloud/Protocol Extensions (Planning Only)**  
    - Status: â¬œ Planning  
    - Tasks: Placeholder docs for future protocols/cloud integration and plugin architectures.  

- **S11: Extensibility IV&V (Control Point)**  
    - Status: â¬œ Pending  
    - Gate: Review and approve future extension points before E5.

### E5: Deployment & Operations Strategy - PENDING E3 COMPLETION

- **S12: Deployment Automation & Ops**  
    - Status: â¬œ Pending  
    - Tasks: Complete deployment scripts, document environment integration, rollback/backup procedures, monitoring/alerting.  

- **S13: Deployment IV&V (Control Point)**  
    - Status: â¬œ Pending  
    - Gate: Validate deployment on target environments, verify ops docs, and backup/recovery.

## ðŸŒ± Cross-Epic Stories

### S14: Automated Testing & Continuous Integration - SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE
- Status: âœ… Substantially Complete  
- Summary: Test suite execution and failure resolution completed. Core testing infrastructure functional. Type checking errors reduced from 95 to 29. Remaining errors are non-blocking polish items.
- Evidence: Test execution artifacts (2025-08-05), functional test suite with `python3 run_all_tests.py`, error reduction across 7 files

### S15: Documentation & Developer Onboarding - PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- Status: ðŸŸ¡ In progress  
- Summary: Core principles, coding standards, and architectural overview exist. Need to (a) capture resolved partials and decisions, (b) sync API docs, (c) provide a concise test/acceptance guide for upcoming IV&V work.  
- Key Deliverables:  
    - Update API docs to reflect actual implemented fields and behaviors.  
    - Document capability confirmation and health recovery policies.  
    - Provide a lightweight acceptance test plan for S5.

## How to Use This Roadmap

- Use the **story-level summaries** above as the authoritative view of current state; the backlog items are the concrete next steps.  
- When a story is completed, update its status, add precise evidence (file/line/commit, test names, doc updates), and sign off per the IV&V Reviewer Checklist.  
- Archive detailed per-file micro-tasks (from prior iterations) in a separate "audit journal" document if needed, keeping this file lean.  
- Reference audit artifacts (the four audit MDs) when closing related story gaps to preserve traceability.

---

## Resolved Blockers / Notes

- [x] **Architecture vs implementation misalignment**: Resolved through S2b audits and updated story definitions.  
- [x] **Method-level versioning ambiguity**: Deferred with canonical STOP-style note in `server.py`; decision logged for revisit post-1.0.  
- [x] **Capability merging policy instability**: Updated to frequency-weighted merge with confirmation window; documented and feeding into S3 metadata flow.  
- [x] **Health monitor recovery flapping risk**: Addressed by introducing consecutive-success confirmation logic (configurable).

## IV&V Reviewer Checklist

Every IV&V (Independent Verification & Validation) control point MUST be reviewed and signed off using the following checklist:

- [ ] All corresponding implementation, documentation, and configuration tasks are complete (not just decidedâ€”built, tested, and validated).
- [ ] All STOP, TODO, and placeholder code related to this control point have been replaced by working, validated logic or explicitly deferred with rationale.
- [ ] No accidental scope/feature creep: The codebase and docs match only what is authorized in the architecture and roadmap.
- [ ] Evidence of completion is present: All roadmap tasks reference the file(s), doc(s), or commit(s) demonstrating completion.
- [ ] All cross-referenced IV&V or Epic/Story dependencies are also satisfied (no unaddressed downstream blockers).
- [ ] Tests for this control point are present, passing, and cover all critical flows.
- [ ] Documentation and changelogs are updated to reflect the change.
- [ ] STOP/BLOCKED items are only marked resolved when actual implementation is present.
- [ ] Any ambiguities or deviations from architecture are annotated for further decision/action (no silent acceptance).
- [ ] Reviewer/lead signs off and records date and name.

> _No Epic, Story, or phase may advance until all checklist items above are checked, with evidence and reviewer signature/date._
