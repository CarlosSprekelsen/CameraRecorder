# Project Roadmap

## üåç Epics (Long-Term Goals)
- **E1: Robust Real-Time Camera Service Core**
    - Deliver a stable, production-ready camera monitoring and control backend fully aligned with the approved architecture.
- **E2: Security and Production Hardening**
    - Complete security features, error recovery, health checks, and deployment automation for a professional release.
- **E3: Client API & SDK Ecosystem**
    - Provide reliable, well-documented client APIs/examples for easy third-party integration.
- **E4: Future Extensibility**
    - Lay groundwork for cloud integration, advanced protocols, and pluggable camera sources.

- **E5: Deployment & Operations Strategy**
    - Story: Review and confirm system integration (systemd vs others)
    - Story: Decide on user permission model (dedicated vs existing)
    - Story: Validate and document production file system layout
    - Story: Define update and rollback strategy
    - Story: Establish backup & recovery procedures
