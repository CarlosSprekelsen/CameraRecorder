# Project Roadmap

## Quality and Control Point Overview

This roadmap enforces a strict quality pipeline to guarantee architectural compliance, implementation rigor, and auditability. **Progression through each phase is controlled by explicit IV&V (Independent Verification & Validation) "control points."** No Epic or Story may advance until all required IV&V gates are fully passed and evidence of implementation is present in both code and documentation.

**The high-level flow is:**

1. **Architecture & Scaffolding**
    - Complete and approve all architecture documents, API contracts, and configuration structures.
    - Implement all method and handler stubs to mirror the architecture (no business logic yet).
    - [IV&V Control Point Gate]: All stubs, APIs, and docs must match the approved architecture before logic is written.

2. **Implementation & Integration**
    - Fill in all business logic, handlers, and error recovery as described in the architecture and stories.
    - Replace all placeholders and STOP/TODOs with working logic.
    - [IV&V Control Point Gate]: Implementation and integration must be reviewed and validated against requirements and architecture.

3. **Testing & Verification**
    - Develop and run all unit, integration, and workflow tests.
    - Ensure code coverage and behavioral correctness.
    - [IV&V Control Point Gate]: All tests must pass, and IV&V review must confirm feature completeness, coding standards, and no accidental scope creep.

4. **Release & Operations**
    - Prepare deployment scripts, operational docs, and rollback strategies.
    - Validate deployment on target environments.
    - [IV&V Control Point Gate]: All deployment and operations steps must be tested, documented, and signed off.

**Key Control Point Rules:**
- **Cannot move to the next Story/Epic/phase until the preceding IV&V "control point" Story is fully checked off.**
- **A task is only marked as [x] complete when both the architectural decision and the corresponding code, documentation, and tests are fully implemented and validated.**
- **STOP/BLOCKED items are moved to "Resolved Blockers" only when implementation is finished and matches the updated architecture.**
- **Every IV&V Story must be validated by review and explicit evidence (file/commit/section) before proceeding.**
- **No scope creep: Features and requirements may only be added or changed through explicit architectural revision and IV&V.**

## IV&V Reviewer Checklist

Every IV&V (Independent Verification & Validation) control point MUST be reviewed and signed off using the following checklist:

- [ ] All corresponding implementation, documentation, and configuration tasks are complete (not just decided‚Äîbuilt, tested, and validated).
- [ ] All STOP, TODO, and placeholder code related to this control point have been replaced by working, validated logic.
- [ ] No accidental scope/feature creep: The codebase and docs match only what is authorized in the architecture and roadmap.
- [ ] Evidence of completion is present: All roadmap tasks reference the file(s), doc(s), or commit(s) demonstrating completion.
- [ ] All cross-referenced IV&V or Epic/Story dependencies are also satisfied (no unaddressed downstream blockers).
- [ ] Tests for this control point are present, passing, and cover all critical flows.
- [ ] Documentation and changelogs are updated to reflect the change.
- [ ] STOP/BLOCKED items are only marked resolved when actual implementation is present.
- [ ] Any ambiguities or deviations from architecture are annotated for further decision/action (no silent acceptance).
- [ ] Reviewer/lead signs off and records date and name.

> _No Epic, Story, or phase may advance until all checklist items above are checked, with evidence and reviewer signature/date._

---

## Pre-Completion Validation Checklist

Before marking any task as [x] complete:
1. [ ] Code change is present and functional (not just TODO/STOP comments)
2. [ ] Related tests exist and pass
3. [ ] Documentation updated if needed  
4. [ ] No NotImplementedError, `pass` statements, or "TODO" comments remain
5. [ ] Reviewer has validated the evidence
6. [ ] Evidence field contains specific file/line/commit references

## IV&V Traceability Audit - Architecture & Scaffolding Only (Recent Findings)

### Forward Tracing Issues Found

1. **TODO Comment Format Non-Compliance**  
   - **Issue:** TODO comments across the codebase do not follow a documented, enforceable format.  
   - **Required Format (per intended standard):**  
     ```
     # TODO: <priority>: <description> [IV&V:<ControlPoint>|Story:<StoryRef>]
     ```  
   - **Non-compliant Examples:**  
     - `src/websocket_server/server.py` line ~30: `# TODO: [CRITICAL] Method-level API versioning framework stub`  
     - `src/websocket_server/server.py` line ~90: `# TODO: Initialize authentication system`  
     - `src/camera_discovery/hybrid_monitor.py` line ~185: `# TODO: Use v4l2-ctl or python v4l2 bindings to probe:`  
   - **Impact:** Existing roadmap claim of "Standardize TODO comment formatting across codebase" is unverifiable because no concrete standard was documented. All TODOs must be aligned to a canonical format and reconciled.  
   - **Actionable Remediation:** See corresponding task in S1b below.

## How to use this Roadmap

- **Tasks are only marked [x] completed when both the architectural decision and the corresponding code/documentation are fully implemented and validated.**  
- **STOP/BLOCKED items are moved to Resolved Blockers only when implementation is finished and matches the updated architecture.**  
- **Open IV&V items must be validated by review before proceeding to next Epic/Story.**  
- **All IV&V control points must be signed off using the IV&V Reviewer Checklist above.**  
- **Use the Pre-Completion Validation Checklist before marking any task as complete.**
