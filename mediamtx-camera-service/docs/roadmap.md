## ðŸŒ± Cross-Epic Stories

### S14: Automated Testing & Continuous Integration - SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE
- Status: âœ… Substantially Complete  
- Summary: Test suite execution and failure resolution completed. Core testing infrastructure functional. Type checking errors reduced from 95 to 29. Remaining errors are non-blocking polish items.
- Evidence: Test execution artifacts (2025-08-05), functional test suite with `python3 run_all_tests.py`, error reduction across 7 files

### S15: Documentation & Developer Onboarding - PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- Status: ðŸŸ¡ In progress  
- Summary: Core principles, coding standards, and architectural overview exist. Need to (a) capture resolved partials and decisions, (b) sync API docs, (c) provide a concise test/acceptance guide for upcoming IV&V work.  
- Key Deliverables:  
    - Update API docs to reflect actual implemented fields and behaviors.  
    - Document capability confirmation and health recovery policies.  
    - Provide a lightweight acceptance test plan for S5.
