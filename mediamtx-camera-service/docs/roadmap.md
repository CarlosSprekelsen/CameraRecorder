# Project Roadmap

## Quality and Control Point Overview

This roadmap enforces a strict quality pipeline to guarantee architectural compliance, implementation rigor, and auditability. **Progression through each phase is controlled by explicit IV&V (Independent Verification & Validation) "control points."** No Epic or Story may advance until all required IV&V gates are fully passed and evidence of implementation is present in both code and documentation.

**The high-level flow:**

1. **Architecture & Scaffolding**
    - Complete and approve all architecture documents, API contracts, and configuration structures.
    - Implement all method and handler stubs to mirror the architecture (no business logic yet).
    - [IV&V Control Point Gate]: All stubs, APIs, and docs must match the approved architecture before logic is written.

2. **Implementation & Integration**
    - Fill in all business logic, handlers, and error recovery as described in the architecture and stories.
    - Replace all placeholders and STOP/TODOs with working logic.
    - [IV&V Control Point Gate]: Implementation and integration must be reviewed and validated against requirements and architecture.

3. **Testing & Verification**
    - Develop and run all unit, integration, and workflow tests.
    - Ensure code coverage and behavioral correctness.
    - [IV&V Control Point Gate]: All tests must pass, and IV&V review must confirm feature completeness, coding standards, and no accidental scope creep.

4. **Release & Operations**
    - Prepare deployment scripts, operational docs, and rollback strategies.
    - Validate deployment on target environments.
    - [IV&V Control Point Gate]: All deployment and operations steps must be tested, documented, and signed off.

**Key Control Point Rules:**
- **Cannot move to the next Story/Epic/phase until the preceding IV&V "control point" Story is fully checked off.**
- **A task is only marked as [x] complete when both the architectural decision and the corresponding code, documentation, and tests are fully implemented and validated.**
- **STOP/BLOCKED items are moved to "Resolved Blockers" only when implementation is finished and matches the updated architecture.**
- **Every IV&V Story must be validated by review and explicit evidence (file/commit/section) before proceeding.**
- **No scope creep: Features and requirements may only be added or changed through explicit architectural revision and IV&V.**

## IV&V Reviewer Checklist

Every IV&V (Independent Verification & Validation) control point MUST be reviewed and signed off using the following checklist:

- [ ] All corresponding implementation, documentation, and configuration tasks are complete (not just decided‚Äîbuilt, tested, and validated).
- [ ] All STOP, TODO, and placeholder code related to this control point have been replaced by working, validated logic or explicitly deferred with rationale.
- [ ] No accidental scope/feature creep: The codebase and docs match only what is authorized in the architecture and roadmap.
- [ ] Evidence of completion is present: All roadmap tasks reference the file(s), doc(s), or commit(s) demonstrating completion.
- [ ] All cross-referenced IV&V or Epic/Story dependencies are also satisfied (no unaddressed downstream blockers).
- [ ] Tests for this control point are present, passing, and cover all critical flows.
- [ ] Documentation and changelogs are updated to reflect the change.
- [ ] STOP/BLOCKED items are only marked resolved when actual implementation is present.
- [ ] Any ambiguities or deviations from architecture are annotated for further decision/action (no silent acceptance).
- [ ] Reviewer/lead signs off and records date and name.

> _No Epic, Story, or phase may advance until all checklist items above are checked, with evidence and reviewer signature/date._

## Pre-Completion Validation Checklist

Before marking any task as [x] complete:
1. [ ] Code change is present and functional (not just TODO/STOP comments)  
2. [ ] Related tests exist and pass  
3. [ ] Documentation updated if needed  
4. [ ] No NotImplementedError, `pass` statements, or "TODO" comments remain unaddressed (or are canonical deferred decisions)  
5. [ ] Reviewer has validated the evidence  
6. [ ] Evidence field contains specific file/line/commit references

    - Status: üü° In progress  
    - Bug / Partial Summary:  
        - ‚úÖ Service manager lifecycle and observability hardening completed: Enhanced camera event orchestration with deterministic sequencing, robust error recovery, and comprehensive observability. Implemented provisional/confirmed metadata state tracking in notifications with correlation ID traceability throughout lifecycle events. Added defensive guards for MediaMTX controller failures with fallback behaviors.
        - Udev event processing test coverage gaps (change events, race conditions, invalid nodes, fallback to polling).  
    - Key Deliverables Remaining:  
        - Expand discovery test coverage for udev event processing edge cases.
    - Evidence: `src/camera_service/service_manager.py` (lines 650-750), `tests/unit/test_camera_service/test_service_manager_lifecycle.py` (complete test suite), notification schema enhanced with metadata validation flags (2025-08-04). 

- **S4: MediaMTX Integration - PARTIALLY COMPLETE**  
    - Status: üü° In progress  
    - Bug / Partial Summary:  
        - ‚úÖ Health monitor edge-case testing completed (2025-08-04): Circuit breaker flapping resistance, recovery confirmation logic, and backoff/jitter behavior comprehensively validated with 33 new test methods.
        - Snapshot capture and recording duration implementation hardened; closure documentation pending.  
        - Logging and error context improvements mostly applied; verify consistency.  
    - Key Deliverables Remaining:  
        - Add explicit architectural decision log entries marking snapshot and duration partials as closed.

## üå± Cross-Epic Stories

### S14: Automated Testing & Continuous Integration - PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- Status: üü° In progress  
- Summary: Test scaffolds exist for core modules (websocket server, MediaMTX controller, service manager, hybrid monitor). Supporting components (`main.py`, `config.py`, `logging_config.py`) require proper stubs and integration. CI pipeline is not fully wired to enforce quality gates.  
- Key Deliverables:  
    - Fill out missing test scaffolds for camera_service support modules.  
    - Add README for test conventions.  
    - Bootstrap CI (lint, type-check, run unit tests).  
    - Surface integration/happy-path test harness for S5.

### S15: Documentation & Developer Onboarding - PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- Status: üü° In progress  
- Summary: Core principles, coding standards, and architectural overview exist. Need to (a) capture resolved partials and decisions, (b) sync API docs, (c) provide a concise test/acceptance guide for upcoming IV&V work.  
- Key Deliverables:  
    - Update API docs to reflect actual implemented fields and behaviors.  
    - Document capability confirmation and health recovery policies.  
    - Provide a lightweight acceptance test plan for S5.

## How to Use This Roadmap

- Use the **story-level summaries** above as the authoritative view of current state; the backlog items are the concrete next steps.  
- When a story is completed, update its status, add precise evidence (file/line/commit, test names, doc updates), and sign off per the IV&V Reviewer Checklist.  
- Archive detailed per-file micro-tasks (from prior iterations) in a separate ‚Äúaudit journal‚Äù document if needed, keeping this file lean.  
- Reference audit artifacts (the four audit MDs) when closing related story gaps to preserve traceability.

## Resolved Blockers / Notes

- [x] **Architecture vs implementation misalignment**: Resolved through S2b audits and updated story definitions.  
- [x] **Method-level versioning ambiguity**: Deferred with canonical STOP-style note in `server.py`; decision logged for revisit post-1.0.  
- [x] **Capability merging policy instability**: Updated to frequency-weighted merge with confirmation window; documented and feeding into S3 metadata flow.  
- [x] **Health monitor recovery flapping risk**: Addressed by introducing consecutive-success confirmation logic (configurable).
