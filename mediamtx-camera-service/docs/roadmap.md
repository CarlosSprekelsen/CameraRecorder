## STOP BLOCKAGES

- [ ] [BLOCKED] Clarification required: ‚Äúmetrics‚Äù field in get_camera_status API response.
      - Context: While implementing get_camera_status (src/websocket_server/server.py), found that API doc (docs/api/json-rpc-methods.md) defines a "metrics" field (bytes_sent, readers, uptime), but this is NOT present or permitted per docs/architecture/overview.md.
      - Action: STOPPED implementation and flagged with a rich TODO in code as required by docs/development/principles.md.
      - Rationale: Per principles.md, do not implement undocumented features; require project architect decision whether "metrics" should be included in camera status response.
      - IV&V Reference: Architecture Compliance IV&V - S2
      - Needed: Update to overview.md or project owner guidance to resolve.

- [ ] [IVV] Validate implementation of "metrics" field in get_camera_status response:
    - Confirm code in `src/websocket_server/server.py` returns metrics field with real values.
    - Confirm API docs and architecture overview match implementation.
    - Confirm all STOP/TODO/placeholder code is removed.
    - Confirm tests (if present) cover metrics field.
    - Reference: Architecture Decision 2025-08-02, IV&V Story S1.

- [ ] [BLOCKED] Clarification required: Hard-coded CameraDevice values in hybrid_monitor.py
    - Context: src/camera_discovery/hybrid_monitor.py, lines 322‚Äì328
    - Action taken: Implementation stopped, rich TODO added to document intentional stub and block further development until v4l2 capability detection is integrated.
    - Rationale: Architecture overview requires real capability detection; hard-coded values violate production requirements.
    - IV&V reference: Story S1, Epic E1
    - Needed: Confirmation of capability detection implementation plan and removal of hard-coded placeholders.

- [ ] [IVV] Validate removal of hard-coded CameraDevice values and implementation of capability detection:
    - Confirm code in `src/camera_discovery/hybrid_monitor.py` uses real capability detection.
    - Confirm architecture overview and code match.
    - Confirm all STOP/TODO/placeholder code is removed.
    - Confirm tests (if present) cover capability detection.
    - Reference: Architecture Decision 2025-08-02, IV&V Story S1.

- [ ] [BLOCKED] Clarification required: Method-level API versioning implementation in server.py
    - Context: src/websocket_server/server.py, class WebSocketJsonRpcServer, method registration/versioning stubs
    - Action taken: Implementation stopped, rich TODO added for version negotiation and migration logic.
    - Rationale: Architecture overview requires method-level versioning, but details for negotiation and migration are not documented.
    - IV&V reference: Architecture Decisions v6, API Versioning Strategy, Story S1
    - Needed: Explicit documentation of versioning requirements, negotiation, and migration strategy.

- [ ] [IVV] Validate method-level API versioning implementation:
    - Confirm code in `src/websocket_server/server.py` registers methods with explicit version.
    - Confirm architecture overview and code match.
    - Confirm all STOP/TODO/placeholder code is removed.
    - Confirm tests (if present) cover versioning logic.
    - Reference: Architecture Decision 2025-08-02, IV&V Story S1.

- [ ] [BLOCKED] Clarification required: Correlation ID integration in WebSocket logging
    - Context: src/websocket_server/server.py, all message handling and notification logging methods
    - Action taken: Implementation stopped, rich TODO added for correlation ID extraction and propagation in logs.
    - Rationale: Architecture overview requires structured logging with correlation IDs, but correlation strategy and propagation details are not documented.
    - IV&V reference: Architecture Decisions v6, Logging Format, Story S1
    - Needed: Explicit documentation of correlation ID format, propagation, and integration with logging system.

- [ ] [IVV] Validate correlation ID integration in WebSocket logging:
    - Confirm code in `src/websocket_server/server.py` includes correlation ID in all relevant logs.
    - Confirm architecture overview and code match.
    - Confirm all STOP/TODO/placeholder code is removed.
    - Confirm tests (if present) cover logging logic.
    - Reference: Architecture Decision 2025-08-02, IV&V Story S1.

- [ ] [BLOCKED] Clarification required: Notification handler interface for camera_status_update in service_manager.py
    - Context: src/camera_service/service_manager.py, _handle_camera_connected/_disconnected/_status_changed methods
    - Action taken: Implementation stopped, rich TODO added to document required notification integration.
    - Rationale: Architecture overview requires camera_status_update notifications, but notification handler interface is not finalized.
    - IV&V reference: Story S1, Epic E1
    - Needed: Finalized notification handler interface and integration guidance.

- [ ] [IVV] Validate notification handler interface and integration for camera_status_update:
    - Confirm code in `src/camera_service/service_manager.py` implements notification handler as per architecture.
    - Confirm architecture overview and code match.
    - Confirm all STOP/TODO/placeholder code is removed.
    - Confirm tests (if present) cover notification logic.
    - Reference: Architecture Decision 2025-08-02, IV&V Story S1.

**How to use this Roadmap:**
- **Cannot move to the next Story/Epic until the preceding IV&V Story is fully checked off.**
- **Control points are explicit workflow blockers, ensuring quality before progress.**
