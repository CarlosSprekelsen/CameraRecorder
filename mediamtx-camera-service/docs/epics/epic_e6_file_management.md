# Epic E6: Server Recording and Snapshot File Management Infrastructure

**Duration:** 4 days  
**Team:** Server Development Team  
**Goal:** Add file management API methods and download endpoints for camera recordings and snapshots to existing MediaMTX Camera Service server  
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ PLANNED  
**Prerequisites:** MediaMTX Camera Service operational (âœ… COMPLETE per roadmap.md E5)  

---

## Epic Overview

Add complete file management capabilities to the existing production-ready MediaMTX Camera Service server. This includes both JSON-RPC API methods for listing files and HTTP endpoints for downloading files, enabling clients to discover and access stored recordings and snapshots.

**Current Server Status (per roadmap.md):**
- âœ… E5: Deployment & Operations Strategy COMPLETE  
- âœ… Production deployment authorized
- âœ… Server operational on port 8002 with SSL on port 443
- âœ… Health endpoints operational on port 8003
- âœ… Nginx reverse proxy configured
- âœ… Recording path: `/opt/camera-service/recordings`
- âœ… Snapshot path: `/opt/camera-service/snapshots`

**Server Enhancement Target:**
- Server provides JSON-RPC API methods: `list_recordings`, `list_snapshots`
- Server provides HTTP file download endpoints: `/files/recordings/`, `/files/snapshots/`  
- Server maintains all existing functionality

- Server snapshot files downloadable with proper image format handling
- Server graceful 404 responses for missing files
- Server download operations logged for security audit trail

### S6.4: Update Existing Nginx Configuration
**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Effort:** 0.5 days  

#### Tasks:
- **S6.4.1:** Add `/files/recordings/` location block to existing nginx configuration  
- **S6.4.2:** Add `/files/snapshots/` location block to existing nginx configuration
- **S6.4.3:** Verify existing WebSocket `/api/ws` routing continues working (port 8002)
- **S6.4.4:** Verify existing health endpoint `/health/` routing continues working (port 8003)
- **S6.4.5:** Test nginx configuration reload with new file endpoints
- **S6.4.6:** Validate SSL/HTTPS continues working for all endpoints

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Server nginx configuration updated with file download locations
- Existing server routing preserved (WebSocket on 8002, health on 8003)
- Server SSL/HTTPS operational for all endpoints including file downloads
- Server nginx configuration reload successful
- All existing server functionality verified operational

### S6.5: Update Existing Installation Procedures
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** 0.5 days  

#### Tasks:
- **S6.5.1:** Update existing server installation script (`deployment/scripts/install.sh`) for file endpoint support
- **S6.5.2:** Verify recording and snapshot directory permissions (`/opt/camera-service/recordings`, `/opt/camera-service/snapshots`)
- **S6.5.3:** Update server validation script (`deployment/scripts/verify_installation.sh`) to test file endpoints and API methods
- **S6.5.4:** Update server production validation (`deployment/scripts/validate_production.sh`) to include file endpoint and API method checks
- **S6.5.5:** Document new file management API methods and download endpoints in installation guide

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Server installation procedures support file download endpoints and API methods
- Server recording/snapshot directory permissions verified correct
- Server validation scripts test both file endpoint functionality and JSON-RPC file listing methods
- Server installation documentation updated with complete file management capabilities
- All existing server installation functionality preserved
