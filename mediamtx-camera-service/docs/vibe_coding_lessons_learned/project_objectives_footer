## Project Structure Organization Test

**Before each sprint completion:**
- [ ] Root folder contains only: README, core config files, main directories
- [ ] Test artifacts stored in `/evidence/sprint-X/` not root folder  
- [ ] Documentation follows single purpose per file
- [ ] No duplicate information across multiple documents
- [ ] Each document has clear owner and purpose
- [ ] Sprint completion follows: Developer → IV&V → PM approval chain

**Red flags indicating over-engineering:**
- More than 3 documents created in single day
- Documents longer than 2 pages without clear sections
- Multiple documents covering same topic
- Test results scattered across multiple locations
- Role confusion in completion claims
