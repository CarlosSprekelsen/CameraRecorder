Excellent recommendation! This addresses the "flapping" problem and provides much more stable recovery behavior. I'll implement the configurable confirmation window for circuit breaker recovery.## 🎯 **Recovery Confirmation Enhancement Implemented**

### **Anti-Flapping Circuit Breaker Design**

I've implemented your recommendation for requiring **N consecutive successful health checks** before fully resetting the circuit breaker. This prevents the "flapping" problem where transient healthy probes briefly clear the breaker only to have failures immediately reopen it.

### **Key Configuration Parameters**### **Evidence Summary: Recovery Confirmation Implementation**## 🎯 **Implementation Complete: Anti-Flapping Circuit Breaker**

### **✅ Key Improvements Delivered**

1. **Recovery Confirmation Window**: Circuit breaker now requires **N consecutive successful health checks** (default: 3) before fully resetting
2. **Anti-Flapping Protection**: Transient healthy probes no longer immediately clear the circuit breaker
3. **Configurable Trade-offs**: Deployments can tune from `1` (fast recovery) to `5+` (ultra-stable)
4. **Enhanced Observability**: Clear logging distinguishes between "improving" and "fully recovered" states

### **🔧 Configuration Flexibility**

```python
# Production recommended (balanced)
MediaMTXController(
    health_recovery_confirmation_threshold=3,  # 3 consecutive successes
    health_failure_threshold=10,               # 10 failures trigger CB
    health_circuit_breaker_timeout=60          # 60s timeout
)

# Development (fast recovery)  
MediaMTXController(
    health_recovery_confirmation_threshold=1   # Immediate recovery (legacy)
)

# High-availability (ultra-stable)
MediaMTXController(
    health_recovery_confirmation_threshold=5   # 5 consecutive successes
)
```

### **📊 Enhanced Recovery Flow**

```
Healthy → Failures (10) → Circuit Breaker ACTIVE
                              ↓ (timeout expires)
                          Recovery PROBING
                              ↓ (success 1/3)
                          Recovery IMPROVING  
                              ↓ (success 2/3)
                          Recovery IMPROVING
                              ↓ (success 3/3)
                          FULLY RECOVERED ✅
                              
# Any failure during recovery resets counter back to 0/3
```

### **🛡️ Benefits Achieved**

- **✅ Eliminates Flapping**: Prevents rapid circuit breaker open/close cycles
- **✅ Configurable**: Tune recovery aggressiveness per deployment needs  
- **✅ Observable**: Clear logging of recovery progress for monitoring
- **✅ Backward Compatible**: Set to `1` for immediate recovery (old behavior)
- **✅ Production Ready**: Sensible default of 3 consecutive successes

### **🧪 Comprehensive Test Coverage**

The implementation includes tests for:
- Recovery confirmation threshold enforcement
- Failure interruption resets confirmation progress  
- Configurable parameter validation
- Enhanced logging verification
- State transition accuracy

This enhancement significantly improves the robustness and operational stability of the MediaMTX health monitoring system while maintaining full configurability for different deployment scenarios.
