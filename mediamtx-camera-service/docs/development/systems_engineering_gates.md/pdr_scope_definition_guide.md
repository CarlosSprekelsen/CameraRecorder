# PDR (Preliminary Design Review) – Scope Definition and Execution Guide (Revised, Action‑Oriented)

**Purpose:** Ensure the detailed design is implementable and validated through working code and measurable evidence, with time‑boxed remediation and a frozen baseline to prevent design drift prior to full implementation.

## PDR Objective

Validate detailed system design completeness and implementability by executing critical prototypes, contract tests, and pipeline runs; convert findings into merged changes before advancing.

## Non‑Goals and Scope Guardrails

- No new features beyond SDR‑approved scope
- No refactors except those required to meet PDR acceptance thresholds
- No expansion of hardware/OS matrix beyond MVP targets

## Global PDR Acceptance Thresholds

- **Design Completeness:** 100% of SDR‑approved requirements mapped to design elements
- **Interface Compliance:** 100% of external APIs have schemas + contract tests passing
- **Performance Budget:** Prototype measurements meet or exceed PDR Budget Table
- **Security Design:** Threat model complete; all High risks mitigated or waived with owner/date
- **Test Strategy:** Working harnesses covering interfaces and critical flows
- **Build System:** CI pipeline green on baseline; reproducible build with checksums
- **Evidence:** All claims linked to artifacts (logs, test outputs, binaries)
- **Timebox:** 7–12 working days; max 2 iterations
