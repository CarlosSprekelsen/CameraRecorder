## Key PDR Principles

**Implementation-Ready:** Every design element validated through working prototypes
**Performance-Proven:** All performance requirements validated through measurement
**Integration-Tested:** System integration approach proven through working framework
**Risk-Mitigated:** All high implementation risks addressed with working solutions
**Team-Ready:** Implementation team capability validated and gaps addressed
**Evidence-Based:** No implementation authorization without working proof

This PDR process ensures that full implementation begins with **validated, implementable designs** rather than untested specifications.
