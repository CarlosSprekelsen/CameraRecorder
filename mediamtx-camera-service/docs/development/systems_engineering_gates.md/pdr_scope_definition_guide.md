# PDR (Preliminary Design Review) – Scope Definition and Execution Guide (No-Mock Implementation)

**Purpose:** Ensure the detailed design is implementable and validated through working code against real systems and measurable evidence, with time‑boxed remediation focused on actual implementation improvements rather than mock fixes.

## PDR Objective

Validate detailed system design completeness and implementability by executing critical prototypes, contract tests, and pipeline runs against real systems; convert findings into merged changes addressing actual implementation issues before advancing.

## Non‑Goals and Scope Guardrails

- No new features beyond SDR‑approved scope
- No refactors except those required to meet PDR acceptance thresholds
- No expansion of hardware/OS matrix beyond MVP targets
- **No mock-based fixes - all fixes must address real implementation issues**

## Global PDR Acceptance Thresholds

- **Design Completeness:** 100% of SDR‑approved requirements mapped to design elements
- **Interface Compliance:** 100% of external APIs have schemas + contract tests passing against real endpoints
- **Performance Budget:** Prototype measurements meet or exceed PDR Budget Table under real load
- **Security Design:** Threat model complete; all High risks mitigated through real security implementations
- **Test Strategy:** Working harnesses covering interfaces and critical flows with real system integration
- **Build System:** CI pipeline green on baseline; reproducible build with real environment validation
- **Evidence:** All claims linked to artifacts from real system execution (logs, test outputs, binaries)
- **Timebox:** 7–12 working days; max 2 iterations

## PDR Implementation Philosophy

**Real Systems First:** All validation must be performed against actual implementations, real integrations, and authentic system behavior. Mock-dependent issues indicate implementation gaps that must be resolved through improved real implementations, not mock adjustments.

7. Tag completion: git tag -a pdr-complete-vX.Y -m "PDR completed - all tests passing against real system"
8. Execute post-merge test validation against real system
9. Update roadmap.md with current status

Create: evidence/pdr-actual/11_final_real_test_validation_merge.md
Update: docs/roadmap.md

Exit Criteria:
- ✅ 100% test pass rate validated against real system
- ✅ PDR working branch merged to main
- ✅ Completion tag created: pdr-complete-vX.Y
- ✅ Post-merge test validation successful against real system
- ✅ Complete git trail: pdr-entry → pdr-baseline → pdr-complete
- ✅ Roadmap updated with real system validation status

Real System Requirements:
- Complete real system operational for final validation and post-merge testing
- CI pipeline integrated with real system for pre-merge validation

Success Criteria: PDR completed with 100% test validation against real system and clean merge to main.

## Evidence Management

### Document Template

```markdown
# Document Title
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Role:** [Developer/IV&V/Project Manager]
**PDR Phase:** [Phase Number]
**Status:** [Draft/Review/Final]

## Real System Test Execution Summary

## Real System Test Results and Evidence

## Real System Performance Measurements

## Real System Integration Validation

## Validation Conclusion
```

### Folder Structure and Naming

**Primary Evidence:** `evidence/pdr-actual/##_<descriptive>.md` (00-pre, 00–11, with 0d, 0e, 2b, 5b, 6b as additions)

**Test Artifacts:** `evidence/pdr-actual/artifacts/` (test outputs from real systems, logs, coverage reports, performance data)

**Working Files:** No temporary files in project root - everything in evidence folder

### Evidence Integrity

- Include test execution outputs and coverage reports from real system execution
- Preserve test logs and performance data from real system operation under `evidence/pdr-actual/artifacts/`
- All claims must link to test execution results from real systems
- Final test execution summary with comprehensive coverage from real system testing required

### Gating Requirements

Subsequent phases cannot start without:
- 100% test pass rate validation against real systems
- Required test coverage thresholds met through real system testing
- Clean test artifact organization from real system execution
- Comprehensive test execution evidence from real systems

## Success Criteria Summary

**PDR Passes When:**
- 100% test suite passing across all categories against real systems
- >95% test coverage achieved and validated through real system testing
- All performance budgets validated through testing against real systems under actual load
- Security validation completed through comprehensive testing against real security mechanisms
- Integration testing successful across all components using real system connections
- Clean project state with organized test artifacts from real system execution
- Final merge to main with post-merge test validation against real system

**PDR Real System Requirements:**
- ✅ Real MediaMTX integration operational throughout PDR
- ✅ Real camera device access or authentic hardware simulators available
- ✅ Real network protocols and API endpoints used for all testing
- ✅ Real security mechanisms and certificates used for security validation
- ✅ Real monitoring and alerting systems operational for performance validation
- ✅ Real deployment infrastructure available for pipeline and operational testing

**PDR Scope Boundaries:**
- ✅ Validates design through comprehensive test execution against real systems
- ✅ Implements and tests critical components and interfaces using real integrations
- ✅ Validates performance budgets through automated testing against real systems
- ❌ Does NOT implement full production features (CDR scope)
- ❌ Does NOT repeat SDR feasibility demonstrations
- ❌ Does NOT expand beyond SDR-approved scope
- ❌ Does NOT allow mock-based fixes or mock-dependent validation
