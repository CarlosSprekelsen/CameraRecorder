## Key CDR Principles

**Production-Ready Focus:** Every validation targets production deployment readiness
**Performance-Driven:** Comprehensive load and stress testing under realistic conditions
**Security-Centric:** Thorough security validation and penetration testing
**Operations-Focused:** Deployment automation and operational procedures validation
**User Experience:** Installation and documentation validation from user perspective
**Evidence-Based Decisions:** No production authorization without comprehensive validation

This CDR process ensures that production deployment is authorized only with **comprehensive validation** of all production readiness criteria.
