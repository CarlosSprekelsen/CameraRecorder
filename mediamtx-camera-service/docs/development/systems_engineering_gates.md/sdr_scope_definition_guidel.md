## Key SDR Principles

**Proof-of-Concept Driven:** Every major decision backed by working demonstration
**Risk-Based:** Focus on highest-risk elements first
**Interface-Centric:** Validate all major interfaces through prototyping
**Technology Validation:** Prove technology stack through spike implementations
**Early Problem Detection:** Surface issues before detailed design investment
**Evidence-Based Decisions:** No claims without working proof

This SDR process ensures that detailed design begins with a **validated, feasible foundation** rather than untested assumptions.
