## Phase 1: Requirements and Architecture Feasibility (2 Days)

### Task 1.1: Requirements Feasibility Validation
```
Your role: IV&V
Ground rules: docs/development/project-ground-rules.md
Role reference: docs/development/roles-responsibilities.md
Task: Validate requirements are complete, testable, and architecturally achievable.

SYSTEMS ENGINEERING APPROACH:
1. Inventory all functional and non-functional requirements
2. Validate each requirement has measurable acceptance criteria
3. Identify requirements that pose architectural risks
4. Map requirements to proposed system components
5. Identify missing or contradictory requirements

FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT:
- Requirements completeness: gaps that would block implementation
- Testability assessment: requirements that cannot be validated
- Architectural impact: requirements that drive design decisions
- Risk identification: requirements with technical uncertainty

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Create requirements_feasibility_report.md with:
- Total requirements: functional/non-functional counts
- Acceptance criteria coverage: measurable vs unmeasurable
- Architecture drivers: requirements that constrain design
- Risk requirements: high technical uncertainty or complexity
- Implementation gaps: missing requirements for complete system

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All requirements have measurable acceptance criteria
- Architecture drivers clearly identified
- Implementation gaps documented
- High-risk requirements flagged for prototype validation

AGENT ADAPTATION:
If requirements unclear → document ambiguities and test assumptions
If acceptance criteria missing → propose measurable alternatives
If conflicts found → document and recommend resolution approach
```

### Task 1.2: Architecture Feasibility Demonstration
```
Your role: Developer
Ground rules: docs/development/project-ground-rules.md
Role reference: docs/development/roles-responsibilities.md
Task: Build minimal working prototype demonstrating core architectural feasibility.

SYSTEMS ENGINEERING APPROACH:
1. Identify highest-risk architectural components
2. Build minimal viable prototype of core architecture
3. Demonstrate critical component interactions
4. Validate technology stack choices through working code
5. Measure performance characteristics of key operations

PROTOTYPE STRATEGY:
- Focus on architectural risk, not feature completeness
- Demonstrate component integration patterns
- Validate external dependencies and interfaces
- Test technology stack under realistic conditions
- Measure performance for critical operations

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Create architecture_feasibility_demo.md with:
- Prototype scope: components and interactions demonstrated
- Technology validation: stack choices proven through working code
- Performance measurements: key operations timing and resource usage
- Integration validation: external dependencies working correctly
- Risk mitigation: architectural concerns addressed through demonstration

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Core architecture demonstrates feasibility through working prototype
- Technology stack validated for target requirements
- Critical component interactions working
- Performance within expected ranges for prototype scale

AGENT ADAPTATION:
If technology issues → document problems and alternative approaches
If integration fails → simplify prototype and focus on core patterns
If performance inadequate → measure actual characteristics and document gaps
```

## Phase 2: Interface and Integration Validation (1-2 Days)

### Task 2.1: Critical Interface Validation
```
Your role: Developer
Ground rules: docs/development/project-ground-rules.md
Role reference: docs/development/roles-responsibilities.md
Task: Validate critical system interfaces through working implementations.

SYSTEMS ENGINEERING APPROACH:
1. Identify all external and internal critical interfaces
2. Implement working versions of highest-risk interfaces
3. Test interfaces with realistic data and error conditions
4. Validate interface contracts and error handling
5. Demonstrate interface integration with external systems

VALIDATION STRATEGY:
- Implement actual interface contracts, not mocks
- Test with realistic data volumes and types
- Exercise error conditions and boundary cases
- Validate integration with external dependencies
- Demonstrate bidirectional communication where required

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Create interface_validation_report.md with:
- Interface inventory: all critical internal and external interfaces
- Implementation status: working vs theoretical interfaces
- Contract validation: data formats, protocols, error handling
- Integration testing: external system connectivity and behavior
- Error handling: boundary conditions and failure modes tested

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Critical interfaces implemented and working with real data
- External integrations demonstrated with actual dependencies
- Error conditions handled appropriately
- Interface contracts validated through testing

AGENT ADAPTATION:
If external systems unavailable → implement stub with realistic behavior
If interface design flawed → document issues and propose alternatives
If integration complex → simplify to essential functionality and document requirements
```

### Task 2.2: End-to-End Integration Validation
```
Your role: IV&V
Ground rules: docs/development/project-ground-rules.md
Role reference: docs/development/roles-responsibilities.md
Task: Validate system integration through end-to-end workflow demonstrations.

SYSTEMS ENGINEERING APPROACH:
1. Define critical system workflows from requirements
2. Execute workflows through prototype implementation
3. Validate data flow and component interactions
4. Test system behavior under realistic conditions
5. Identify integration gaps and architectural issues

VALIDATION METHODOLOGY:
- Execute complete workflows end-to-end
- Use realistic data and conditions
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Validate system behavior matches requirements
- Identify performance and scalability implications

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Create integration_validation_results.md with:
- Workflow execution: critical paths tested end-to-end
- Component interaction: data flow and communication patterns validated
- System behavior: requirements satisfaction through actual operation
- Performance characteristics: response times and resource utilization
- Integration gaps: missing components or incomplete interactions

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Critical workflows execute successfully end-to-end
- System behavior matches requirements expectations
- Component interactions work reliably
- Performance adequate for intended scale

AGENT ADAPTATION:
If workflows incomplete → test available components and document gaps
If performance issues → measure actual characteristics and assess requirements
If integration failures → isolate issues and test components individually
```

## Phase 3: Design Authorization (1 Day)

### Task 3.1: Technical Risk Assessment
```
Your role: IV&V
Ground rules: docs/development/project-ground-rules.md
Role reference: docs/development/roles-responsibilities.md
Task: Assess remaining technical risks and validate design readiness for detailed implementation.

SYSTEMS ENGINEERING APPROACH:
1. Review all prototype and integration results
2. Identify remaining technical risks and uncertainties
3. Assess design completeness for detailed implementation
4. Evaluate technology stack maturity and support
5. Validate design can scale to full requirements

RISK ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK:
- Technical risks: unproven technologies or approaches
- Integration risks: component interaction complexity
- Performance risks: scalability and resource requirements
- External dependency risks: third-party system reliability
- Implementation risks: development complexity and schedule

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Create technical_risk_assessment.md with:
- Risk inventory: identified technical and implementation risks
- Risk mitigation: strategies for addressing each risk category
- Design completeness: readiness for detailed implementation phase

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All high technical risks identified and mitigated
- Design proven feasible through working demonstrations
