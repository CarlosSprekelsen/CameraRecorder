Mock type definitions for MediaMTX Camera Service testing.

Requirements Traceability:
- REQ-UTIL-007: Mock types shall provide standardized mock object definitions for testing
- REQ-UTIL-018: Mock types shall support minimal strategic mocking when real components unavailable
- REQ-UTIL-019: Mock types shall provide consistent mock interfaces across test modules
- REQ-UTIL-020: Mock types shall support real component testing patterns

Story Coverage: Test stories requiring minimal strategic mocking
IV&V Control Point: Mock type validation and real component testing support

This module provides:
1. Standardized mock object definitions
2. Minimal strategic mocking support
3. Consistent mock interfaces
4. Real component testing patterns
5. Mock type validation utilities

Note: These mocks are for minimal strategic use only when real components are unavailable.
Real component testing is preferred over mocking per testing guidelines.
