"""
Mock type definitions for MediaMTX Camera Service testing.

This module provides:
1. Standardized mock object definitions
2. Minimal strategic mocking support
3. Consistent mock interfaces
4. Real component testing patterns
5. Mock type validation utilities

Note: These mocks are for minimal strategic use only when real components are unavailable.
Real component testing is preferred over mocking per testing guidelines.
