# Test Files Quarantine Documentation

**Date:** 2025-08-20  
**Reason:** Test suite consolidation and organization per testing guide compliance  
**Status:** Quarantined for potential future reference  

## Quarantined Test Variations

### WebSocket Server Tests (old_variations/)
These files were consolidated into `test_server_status_aggregation_consolidated.py`:

1. **`test_server_status_aggregation_enhanced.py`**
   - Requirements: REQ-WS-001, REQ-WS-002, REQ-WS-003, REQ-ERROR-001, REQ-ERROR-002, REQ-ERROR-003
   - Tests: 7 comprehensive status aggregation tests
   - Status: Consolidated into main status aggregation file

2. **`test_real_integration_fixed.py`**
   - Requirements: REQ-WS-001
   - Tests: 5 real integration tests with fixed async handling
   - Status: Consolidated into main status aggregation file

3. **`test_server_real_connections_simple.py`**
   - Requirements: REQ-WS-001, REQ-WS-002, REQ-WS-003, REQ-ERROR-007, REQ-ERROR-008
   - Tests: 2 simple connection tests
   - Status: Consolidated into main status aggregation file

### Integration Tests (old_variations/)
These files were variations of integration tests:

4. **`test_sdk_real_response_format.py`**
   - Requirements: SDK response format validation
   - Status: To be consolidated with main SDK tests

5. **`test_sdk_real_functionality.py`**
   - Requirements: SDK functionality validation
   - Status: To be consolidated with main SDK tests

6. **`test_logging_config_real.py`**
   - Requirements: Real logging configuration validation
   - Status: To be consolidated with main logging tests

7. **`test_real_system_integration_enhanced.py`**
   - Requirements: Enhanced real system integration
   - Status: To be consolidated with main integration tests

## Evidence Archive (evidence_archive/)

The entire `evidence/` directory was moved here to remove evidence pollution from the test structure. This includes:

- Test artifacts and debug files
- Performance testing results
- Security scan results
- Various test evidence files

## Recovery Instructions

If any of these files need to be referenced or restored:

1. **For test variations:** Check the consolidated files first, as they preserve all requirements traceability
2. **For evidence:** Files are preserved in `evidence_archive/` directory
3. **For specific test cases:** All test functions and requirements have been preserved in consolidated versions

## Requirements Traceability Preserved

All requirements traceability has been preserved in the consolidated files:
- REQ-WS-001 through REQ-WS-003
- REQ-ERROR-001 through REQ-ERROR-008
- REQ-CAM-001, REQ-CAM-003
- REQ-MEDIA-001

## Next Steps

1. Review consolidated files to ensure all test coverage is maintained
2. Update any references to quarantined files
3. Consider permanent deletion after validation period (30 days)
