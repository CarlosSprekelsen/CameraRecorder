**Assessment**: Requirements provide comprehensive and measurable acceptance criteria for design validation. The 97.5% adequacy rate exceeds the 95% target threshold.

### 2. Design Traceability Sufficient for Feasibility Demonstration

#### ✅ CRITERION MET - 100% Traceability Rate

**Evidence from Requirements Traceability Validation**:
- **Total Requirements**: 119 requirements
- **Traceable to Design**: 119 requirements (100%)
- **Target**: ≥95%
- **Status**: ✅ PASS

**Traceability Mapping**:
- **Functional Requirements**: All trace to WebSocket JSON-RPC Server, MediaMTX Controller, Camera Discovery Monitor
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: All trace to architecture patterns and component responsibilities
- **Technical Specifications**: All trace to specific implementation details
- **Platform Requirements**: All trace to client-side implementation (API provides foundation)
- **API Requirements**: All trace to specific server methods and endpoints
- **Architecture Requirements**: All trace to specific components in architecture diagram

**Assessment**: Complete traceability provides clear implementation paths for all requirements. 100% traceability rate ensures no requirements are orphaned or unaddressable.

### 3. No Critical Inconsistencies Blocking Design Validation

#### ✅ CRITERION MET - 0% Inconsistency Rate

**Evidence from Ground Truth Consistency Validation**:
- **Documents Reviewed**: 4 foundational documents
- **Total Inconsistencies Found**: 0 (0% inconsistency rate)
- **Critical Inconsistencies**: 0
- **High Inconsistencies**: 0
- **Medium Inconsistencies**: 0
- **Low Inconsistencies**: 0

**Consistency Validation Results**:
- **Requirements ↔ API Specification**: Perfect alignment across all functional, security, and performance requirements
- **Architecture ↔ Requirements**: Perfect alignment across all component responsibilities and data flows
- **API ↔ Architecture**: Perfect alignment across all methods and endpoints
- **Technology Stack ↔ Requirements**: Perfect alignment across performance targets and security models

**Assessment**: Zero inconsistencies ensure no contradictions prevent feasibility demonstration. All documents are internally consistent and cross-aligned.

## Minor Issues Analysis (Non-Blocking)

### 1. N4.4: Offline Mode Support (Low Priority)
**Issue**: "Limited functionality" not defined in offline mode requirement
**Impact**: Cannot fully validate offline mode implementation
**Resolution**: Define specific offline capabilities in next requirements iteration
**Status**: Non-blocking for SDR - Client-side responsibility

### 2. Duration Parameter Units (Low Priority)
**Issue**: Requirements specify multiple duration units, API uses seconds only
**Impact**: Minor implementation difference
**Resolution**: Client can convert units to seconds
**Status**: Non-blocking for SDR - Simple client-side conversion

### 3. WebRTC Preview Integration (Medium Priority)
**Issue**: Depends on MediaMTX WebRTC support (future enhancement)
**Impact**: Browser camera preview functionality limited
**Resolution**: Document as future enhancement, not blocking for MVP
**Status**: Non-blocking for SDR - Future enhancement

### Assessment: All Minor Issues Are Non-Blocking
- **No Critical Issues**: All requirements are implementable and testable
- **No High Issues**: No significant contradictions prevent feasibility
- **Clear Implementation Paths**: All requirements have clear implementation approaches
- **Strong Foundation**: 97.5% of requirements are ready for implementation
