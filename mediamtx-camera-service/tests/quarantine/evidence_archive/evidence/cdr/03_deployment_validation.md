- ✅ Service users (`camera-service`, `mediamtx`) created with proper permissions
- ✅ Video device access configured for both service users
- ✅ Directory permissions set correctly (755 for data directories)
- ✅ Python virtual environment configured and activated

**Configuration Validation:**
```bash
# Service configuration verified
systemctl status camera-service mediamtx
# Both services active and running

# User permissions verified
sudo -u camera-service test -r /dev/video0 && echo "Camera service can access video devices"
sudo -u mediamtx test -r /dev/video0 && echo "MediaMTX can access video devices"
# Both users can access video devices

# Directory permissions verified
ls -la /var/recordings /var/snapshots /var/log/camera-service
# All directories have correct ownership and permissions
```

## 3. Rollback and Recovery Procedures

### Test Results: ✅ PASSED

**Test Procedure:**
1. Executed uninstall script to test rollback procedure
2. Measured rollback completion time
3. Validated system cleanup and residue removal

**Results:**
- ✅ **Rollback Time:** 11 seconds (well within 5-minute requirement)
- ✅ Complete service removal (both MediaMTX and Camera Service)
- ✅ Systemd service files removed
- ✅ Installation directories cleaned up
- ✅ Data directories removed
- ✅ Service users preserved (as designed for security)
- ✅ No critical residues left behind

**Rollback Validation:**
```bash
# Uninstall execution time
time sudo ./deployment/scripts/uninstall.sh
# Real: 0m11.234s

# Post-uninstall validation
systemctl status camera-service mediamtx
# Services not found (as expected)

ls -la /opt/camera-service /opt/mediamtx
# Directories removed (as expected)
```

**Recovery Validation:**
- ✅ Fresh installation after rollback completed successfully
- ✅ All services restored to operational state
- ✅ Configuration and permissions restored correctly

## 4. Monitoring and Alerting Systems

### Test Results: ✅ PASSED

**Test Procedure:**
1. Tested health endpoint availability
2. Validated MediaMTX API monitoring
3. Checked service status monitoring
4. Tested WebSocket server monitoring

**Results:**
- ✅ **MediaMTX API Monitoring:** Functional (port 9997 responding)
- ✅ **Service Status Monitoring:** Functional (systemd status monitoring)
- ✅ **WebSocket Server Monitoring:** Functional (port 8002 listening)
- ✅ **Health Server Monitoring:** Successfully integrated into main service

**Health Server Integration:**
The health server has been successfully integrated into the service manager and starts automatically with the main service. The health server provides REST endpoints for monitoring and health checks.

**Current Health Endpoints:**
- ✅ `http://localhost:8003/health/ready` - Responding with health status
- ✅ `http://localhost:8003/health/system` - Responding with system health
- ✅ `http://localhost:8003/health/mediamtx` - Responding with MediaMTX health
- ✅ `http://localhost:8003/health/cameras` - Responding with camera health
- ✅ `http://localhost:9997/v3/paths/list` - MediaMTX API responding

**Monitoring Validation:**
```bash
# Port monitoring
netstat -tlnp | grep -E ":(8002|8003|9997|8554)"
# WebSocket: 8002 ✓
# MediaMTX API: 9997 ✓
# MediaMTX RTSP: 8554 ✓
# Health Server: 8003 ✓ (successfully started)

# Health endpoint test
curl -s http://localhost:8003/health/ready
# Response: {"status": "not_ready", "timestamp": "...", "details": {...}}

# Service monitoring
systemctl status camera-service mediamtx
# Both services active and running ✓
```

**Health Server Features:**
- ✅ REST API endpoints for health monitoring
