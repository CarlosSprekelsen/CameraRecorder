## 1. Requirements Compliance Assessment

### 1.1 REQ-PERF-001: Concurrent Operations Performance

**Requirement:** System shall handle concurrent camera operations efficiently
- **Target:** 50-100 simultaneous WebSocket connections
- **Actual Performance:** ❌ FAILED - Connection limit reached at 50 connections
- **Evidence:** Scalability testing showed "Connection limit reached" errors at 50 concurrent connections
- **Compliance Status:** NON-COMPLIANT

**Analysis:**
- The WebSocket server has a hard connection limit that prevents scaling beyond 50 concurrent connections
- This represents a critical bottleneck for multi-user scenarios

- **Actual Performance:** ✅ COMPLIANT - Response times within acceptable range before connection limit
- **Evidence:** Average response times remained under 200ms for successful connections
- **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT (within operational limits)

**Analysis:**
- Response time performance is acceptable when connections are within limits
- Performance degrades gracefully until connection limit is reached
- No significant response time degradation observed before failure point

### 1.3 REQ-PERF-003: Latency Requirements for Real-time Operations

- System handles resource constraints appropriately

### 1.5 REQ-PERF-005: Throughput Performance

**Requirement:** System shall process requests at specified throughput rates
- **Target:** 100-200 requests/second
- **Actual Performance:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Throughput limited by connection constraints
- **Evidence:** Throughput calculations show capability within limits, but limited by connection count
- **Compliance Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLIANT

**Analysis:**
- Individual request processing meets throughput requirements
- Overall system throughput limited by connection limit rather than processing capacity
- Throughput scales with available connections

### 1.6 REQ-PERF-006: Scalability Performance

**Requirement:** System shall scale performance with available resources
- **Target:** Linear scaling with available resources
- **Actual Performance:** ❌ FAILED - Hard connection limit prevents scaling
- **Evidence:** System cannot scale beyond 50 concurrent connections regardless of available resources
- **Compliance Status:** NON-COMPLIANT

**Analysis:**
- The hard connection limit represents a fundamental scalability bottleneck
- System cannot leverage additional resources to increase capacity
- This limitation affects the ability to support multiple users simultaneously
