## 2. Performance Requirements Compliance

### 2.1 REQ-PERF-001: Concurrent Operations Performance

**Requirement:** System shall handle concurrent camera operations efficiently
- **Target:** 50-100 simultaneous WebSocket connections
- **Test Result:** ❌ FAILED - Connection limit reached at 50 connections
- **Evidence:** "Connection limit reached" errors at 50 concurrent connections
- **Compliance Status:** NON-COMPLIANT

**Analysis:**
- The WebSocket server has a hard connection limit that prevents scaling beyond 50 concurrent connections
- This represents a critical bottleneck for multi-user scenarios
- The limit is reached before the target of 100 connections specified in requirements

**Requirement:** System shall maintain responsive performance under load
- **Target:** < 500ms response time for 95% of requests
- **Test Result:** ✅ COMPLIANT - Response times within acceptable range before connection limit
- **Evidence:** Average response times remained under 10ms for successful connections
- **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT (within operational limits)

**Analysis:**
- Response time performance is excellent when connections are within limits
- Performance degrades gracefully until connection limit is reached
- No significant response time degradation observed before failure point

### 2.3 REQ-PERF-003: Latency Requirements for Real-time Operations

**Requirement:** System shall meet latency requirements for real-time operations
- **Target:** < 100ms latency for real-time operations
- **Test Result:** ✅ COMPLIANT - Latency within real-time requirements
- **Evidence:** WebSocket ping operations completed within 100ms threshold
- **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT

**Analysis:**
- Real-time operations meet latency requirements
- WebSocket communication is responsive for camera control operations
- No latency issues identified in the tested range

### 2.4 REQ-PERF-004: Resource Constraints Handling

**Requirement:** System shall handle resource constraints gracefully
- **Target:** CPU < 70%, Memory < 512MB under normal load
- **Test Result:** ✅ COMPLIANT - Resource usage within limits
- **Evidence:** CPU usage < 60%, Memory usage < 50MB during testing
- **Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT

**Analysis:**
- Resource utilization remains well within acceptable limits
- No memory leaks or resource exhaustion observed
- System handles resource constraints appropriately

### 2.5 REQ-PERF-005: Throughput Performance

**Requirement:** System shall process requests at specified throughput rates
- **Target:** 100-200 requests/second
- **Test Result:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Throughput limited by connection constraints
- **Evidence:** Throughput calculations show capability within limits, but limited by connection count
- **Compliance Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLIANT

**Analysis:**
- Individual request processing meets throughput requirements
- Overall system throughput limited by connection limit rather than processing capacity
- Throughput scales with available connections

### 2.6 REQ-PERF-006: Scalability Performance

**Requirement:** System shall scale performance with available resources
- **Target:** Linear scaling with available resources
- **Test Result:** ❌ FAILED - Hard connection limit prevents scaling
- **Evidence:** System cannot scale beyond 50 concurrent connections regardless of available resources
- **Compliance Status:** NON-COMPLIANT

**Analysis:**
- The hard connection limit represents a fundamental scalability bottleneck
- System cannot leverage additional resources to increase capacity
- This limitation affects the ability to support multiple users simultaneously
