# Requirements Mapping Guide

**Purpose:** Ensure all tests have proper requirements traceability and follow consistent mapping patterns.

## Overview

Every test must clearly trace to specific requirements using standardized REQ-* references. This guide provides patterns and examples for proper requirements mapping.

## Requirements Reference Format

### Standard Format

- **REQ-CAM-***: Camera discovery requirements
- **REQ-SVC-***: Service manager requirements
- **REQ-CONFIG-***: Configuration requirements
- **REQ-INT-***: Integration requirements

## Requirements Coverage Validation

### Coverage Checklist
- [ ] Every test method has requirements listed in docstring
- [ ] Requirements use correct REQ-[MODULE]-[NUMBER] format
- [ ] Error requirements are mapped for error condition tests
- [ ] Integration requirements are mapped for integration tests
- [ ] Performance requirements are mapped for performance tests
- [ ] Security requirements are mapped for security tests

### Coverage Matrix Example
```python
# Requirements coverage tracking
REQUIREMENT_COVERAGE = {
    "REQ-WS-001": [
        "test_websocket_server_real_mediamtx_integration",
        "test_websocket_server_camera_status_aggregation"
    ],
    "REQ-WS-002": [
        "test_websocket_server_capability_metadata_integration",
        "test_websocket_server_fallback_to_defaults"
    ],
    "REQ-ERROR-001": [
        "test_websocket_server_mediamtx_connection_failure",
        "test_websocket_server_service_unavailability"
    ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Specific Requirements
- Map each test to specific, identifiable requirements
- Avoid generic requirement references
- Use the most specific requirement that applies

### 2. Multiple Requirements
- List all relevant requirements for each test
- Separate requirements with commas
- Order requirements by importance

### 3. Error Requirements
- Always include error requirements for error condition tests
- Map specific error scenarios to specific error requirements
- Ensure error handling is properly validated

### 4. Integration Requirements
- Include integration requirements for end-to-end tests
- Map component interaction requirements
- Validate real component integration

### 5. Documentation
- Keep requirements descriptions clear and concise
- Update requirements when they change
- Maintain requirements traceability matrix

## Validation Tools

### Automated Validation
```python
def validate_requirements_traceability(test_file_path: str):
    """Validate that test file has proper requirements traceability."""
    with open(test_file_path, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    # Check for requirements traceability header
    if 'Requirements Traceability:' not in content:
        print(f"WARNING: {test_file_path} missing requirements traceability header")
    
    # Check for REQ-* references
    import re
    req_pattern = r'REQ-[A-Z]+-\d+'
    requirements = re.findall(req_pattern, content)
    
    if not requirements:
        print(f"WARNING: {test_file_path} missing REQ-* references")
    
    return len(requirements)
```

### Manual Validation Checklist
- [ ] Test file has requirements traceability header
- [ ] Each test method lists relevant requirements
- [ ] Requirements use correct format (REQ-[MODULE]-[NUMBER])
- [ ] Error tests include error requirements
- [ ] Integration tests include integration requirements
- [ ] Requirements descriptions are clear and accurate

## Conclusion

Proper requirements mapping ensures:
- Clear traceability between tests and requirements
- Comprehensive test coverage validation
- Easy identification of missing test coverage
- Compliance with test guidelines
- Effective IV&V validation

Follow these patterns consistently to maintain high-quality test documentation and requirements traceability.
