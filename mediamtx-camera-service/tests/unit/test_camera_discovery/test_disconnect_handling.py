"""
Comprehensive tests for camera disconnect handling using real components.

Tests the enhanced disconnect event processing, state consistency validation,
and resource cleanup across all components as specified in PDR conditions.
Uses real MediaMTX service, WebSocket server, and camera devices instead of mocks.

Requirements Traceability:
- REQ-CAM-002: System shall handle camera disconnection gracefully
- REQ-ERR-001: System shall handle errors gracefully without crashing
- REQ-INT-001: System shall maintain state consistency across components
- REQ-API-003: System shall provide real-time camera status notifications

PDR Condition Coverage:
- Camera Disconnect Handling (High Priority): Fix camera event processing
- Camera State Consistency Validation (High Priority): Ensure state consistency

Story Coverage: PDR Conditions Resolution
IV&V Control Point: Camera disconnect handling validation
