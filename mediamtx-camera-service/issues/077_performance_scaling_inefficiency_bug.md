# Issue 077: Performance Scaling Inefficiency

**Status:** üêõ OPEN

## Summary

The performance scaling test is failing because the system is not efficiently utilizing resources according to the expected scaling model. Memory efficiency is particularly poor (2.50x target).

## Details

### Test Results
- **Expected Scaling:** 0.8-1.2 efficiency factor for both CPU and Memory
- **Actual Results:**
  - CPU efficiency: 1.02 (within range)
  - Memory efficiency: 2.50 (exceeds max by 108%)
- **Test:** `test_performance_scaling_resources`
- **Failure:** Memory scaling not efficient

### Root Cause Analysis
The system is using significantly more memory than expected for the given utilization level:

1. **Memory overhead** - Python memory management overhead
2. **Inefficient resource utilization** - System not scaling memory usage efficiently
3. **Baseline memory usage** - High idle memory consumption
4. **Scaling model mismatch** - Expected vs actual memory scaling behavior

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** HIGH - Inefficient resource utilization affects system capacity
- **Scope:** Memory management and scaling efficiency
- **User Impact:** Reduced system capacity and potential memory exhaustion

## Investigation Required

### Performance Analysis
- [ ] Profile memory usage patterns
- [ ] Analyze Python memory management overhead
- [ ] Investigate memory leaks or inefficient allocation
- [ ] Compare with baseline system memory usage

### Optimization Opportunities
- [ ] Optimize memory allocation patterns
- [ ] Reduce Python memory overhead
- [ ] Implement memory pooling for frequently allocated objects
- [ ] Consider garbage collection optimization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Memory efficiency within 0.8-1.2 range
- [ ] CPU efficiency maintained or improved
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Resource utilization optimized
