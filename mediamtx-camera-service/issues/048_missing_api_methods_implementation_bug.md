# Bug Report: Missing API Methods Implementation

**Bug ID:** 048  
**Title:** Missing API Methods Implementation  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Category:** API/Implementation  
**Status:** Identified  

## Summary

Several API methods that are expected by tests and documented in the API specification are not implemented in the WebSocket server. These methods return "Method not found" errors when called.

## Detailed Description

### Root Cause
The following API methods are missing from the WebSocket server implementation:
- `get_recording_info`
- `get_snapshot_info` 
- `delete_recording`

These methods are expected by integration tests and should be implemented according to the API specification.

### Impact
- Integration tests fail with "Method not found" errors
- API functionality is incomplete
- Client applications cannot access expected features
- Test coverage gaps for critical functionality

### Evidence
Test failures showing "Method not found" errors:
```
FAILED tests/integration/test_critical_interfaces.py::test_get_recording_info_success - AssertionError: Response should contain 'result' field
FAILED tests/integration/test_critical_interfaces.py::test_get_snapshot_info_success - AssertionError: Response should contain 'result' field  
FAILED tests/integration/test_critical_interfaces.py::test_delete_recording_success - AssertionError: Response should contain 'result' field
```

## Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Implement Missing Methods (Recommended)
1. **Implement `get_recording_info` method**
   - Add method to WebSocket server
   - Return recording file metadata (filename, size, timestamp, etc.)
   - Follow API specification format

2. **Implement `get_snapshot_info` method**
   - Add method to WebSocket server
   - Return snapshot file metadata (filename, size, resolution, etc.)
   - Follow API specification format

3. **Implement `delete_recording` method**
   - Add method to WebSocket server
   - Handle file deletion with proper error handling
   - Return deletion status

### Option 2: Remove Tests for Unimplemented Methods
- Remove or skip tests for unimplemented methods
- Update API documentation to reflect current implementation
- Mark methods as "not yet implemented"

### Option 3: Implement Stub Methods
- Add stub implementations that return appropriate error responses
- Document methods as "not yet implemented"
- Allow tests to pass with expected error responses

## Implementation Priority

**High Priority:**
- `get_recording_info` - Required for recording management
- `get_snapshot_info` - Required for snapshot management

**Medium Priority:**
- `delete_recording` - Required for file cleanup operations

## Test Validation

After implementation, validate with:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_critical_interfaces.py::test_get_recording_info_success -v
python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_critical_interfaces.py::test_get_snapshot_info_success -v
python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_critical_interfaces.py::test_delete_recording_success -v
```

## Conclusion

This is a **medium-priority implementation gap** where expected API functionality is missing. The missing methods need to be implemented to complete the API functionality and make tests pass. This affects the completeness of the API and user experience. The implementation should be prioritized based on user needs and requirements.
