# Issue 083: Health Endpoints Missing Documentation Reference Bug

**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Type:** API Compliance Bug  
**Created:** 2025-01-23  
**Discovered By:** API Compliance Audit  

## Description

**CRITICAL VIOLATION**: The health monitoring test file is missing mandatory health endpoints documentation reference. This violates the fundamental principle that **health endpoints documentation is ground truth** and tests must validate against documented health API behavior.

## Root Cause Analysis

### **Affected File:**
- `tests/health/test_health_monitoring.py`

### **Violation Details:**
- **Missing Health Endpoints Reference**: No reference to `docs/api/health-endpoints.md` in docstring
- **Missing API Documentation Reference**: No reference to `docs/api/json-rpc-methods.md` in docstring
- **Ground Truth Violation**: Tests may be using implementation details instead of documented health endpoints

### **Health Endpoints Documentation:**
- **Ground Truth**: `docs/api/health-endpoints.md` is the ONLY source of truth for health API
- **Documented Endpoints**: `/health/system`, `/health/cameras`, `/health/mediamtx`
- **Response Format**: Documented health response format and status codes
- **Authentication**: Documented authentication requirements for health endpoints

## Impact Assessment

**Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Health Monitoring**: Tests may not validate against documented health endpoints
- **Quality Assurance**: False sense of security if health tests don't validate documented API
- **System Monitoring**: Health monitoring may not catch real health endpoint issues
- **Client Integration**: Health monitoring may not work correctly with documented endpoints

## Required Fixes

### **Mandatory Documentation References**

#### **For Health Tests:**
The health monitoring test file MUST include in its docstring:
```python
"""
Health monitoring tests for MediaMTX Camera Service.

Health Endpoints Reference: docs/api/health-endpoints.md
API Documentation Reference: docs/api/json-rpc-methods.md

Requirements Coverage:
- REQ-HEALTH-001: Comprehensive health monitoring for MediaMTX service
- REQ-HEALTH-002: Health monitoring capabilities for all components
- REQ-HEALTH-003: Health monitoring for camera discovery components
- REQ-HEALTH-004: Health monitoring for service manager components
- REQ-HEALTH-005: Health status with detailed component information
- REQ-HEALTH-006: Kubernetes readiness probes support

Test Categories: Health
"""
```

### **Validation Requirements**

#### **Health Endpoints Validation:**
1. **Endpoint URLs**: Use documented health endpoint URLs from `health-endpoints.md`
2. **Response Format**: Validate documented health response format
3. **Status Codes**: Use documented HTTP status codes
4. **Response Fields**: Check all documented health fields are present
5. **Authentication**: Follow documented authentication requirements

#### **API Compliance Validation:**
1. **Request Format**: Use exact request formats from `json-rpc-methods.md`
2. **Response Format**: Validate all documented response fields are present
3. **Error Codes**: Use documented error codes and messages
4. **Authentication Flow**: Follow documented authentication flow exactly

## Implementation Instructions

### **Step 1: Add Documentation References**
Add both health endpoints and API documentation references to the module docstring.

### **Step 2: Validate Health Endpoints Compliance**
After adding references, verify that:
- Tests use documented health endpoint URLs
- Tests validate documented health response format
- Tests use documented HTTP status codes
- Tests check all documented health fields are present

### **Step 3: Validate API Compliance**
Verify that:
- Tests use documented request formats
- Tests validate documented response formats
- Tests use documented error codes
- Tests follow documented authentication flow

### **Step 4: Remove Implementation References**
Ensure tests do NOT reference:
- Server implementation details
- Internal method names
- Implementation-specific behavior
- Undocumented health features

### **Step 5: Test Validation**
Run the API compliance audit again to ensure:
- Health endpoints violation is resolved
- API compliance violations are resolved
- Tests validate against documented health endpoints
- No new violations are introduced

## Testing Guidelines Compliance

### **Critical Rules to Follow:**
1. **Health Endpoints Documentation is Ground Truth** - Use `docs/api/health-endpoints.md` as ONLY source of truth
2. **API Documentation is Ground Truth** - Use `docs/api/json-rpc-methods.md` as ONLY source of truth
3. **NEVER use server implementation as reference** - Only use documented APIs
4. **Tests must validate against documentation** - Not against server implementation
5. **If test fails, check documentation first** - Don't adapt test to broken implementation

### **Authorization Required:**
- **STOP before modifying any code** - Investigate and understand the issue first
- **Ask for explicit authorization** before making any code changes
- **No working in isolation** - Coordinate with team before implementation
- **Present options and recommendations** for team decision

## Acceptance Criteria

### **For Health Monitoring Test File:**
- [ ] **Health Endpoints Reference Added**: Reference to `docs/api/health-endpoints.md` in docstring
- [ ] **API Documentation Reference Added**: Reference to `docs/api/json-rpc-methods.md` in docstring
- [ ] **Health Endpoints Validated**: Tests use documented health endpoint URLs
- [ ] **Response Format Validated**: Tests validate documented health response format
- [ ] **Status Codes Validated**: Tests use documented HTTP status codes
- [ ] **Implementation References Removed**: No server implementation details in tests

### **Overall Compliance:**
- [ ] **Health Endpoints Violation Resolved**: No missing health endpoints reference
- [ ] **API Compliance Audit Passes**: No violations in subsequent audit
- [ ] **Tests Validate Ground Truth**: All tests validate against documented APIs
- [ ] **Health Monitoring Quality**: Tests catch real health endpoint issues

## Priority

**CRITICAL** - This violates the fundamental principle of health endpoints documentation as ground truth. The health monitoring test file must be fixed to ensure tests validate against documented health API behavior, not server implementation details.
