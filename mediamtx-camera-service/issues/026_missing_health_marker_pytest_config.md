# Bug Report: Missing health marker in pytest configuration

**Issue ID:** 026  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** OPEN  
**Date:** 2025-01-06  
**Reporter:** IV&V Team  

## Summary
The pytest configuration file `pytest.ini` is missing the `health` marker definition, causing test collection to fail for health-related tests.

## Description
When running the test suite, the following error occurs during test collection:

```
ERROR collecting tests/health/test_health_monitoring.py
'health' not found in `markers` configuration option
```

## Root Cause
The `pytest.ini` file defines various test markers but does not include the `health` marker that is used by health monitoring tests.

## Impact
- Test collection fails for health monitoring tests
- Prevents execution of health-related requirement validation
- Blocks comprehensive test coverage validation
- Violates testing guide requirements for proper test organization

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run the test suite: `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v`
2. Observe test collection error for `tests/health/test_health_monitoring.py`

## Expected Behavior
Health tests should be collected and executed successfully with proper marker support.

## Actual Behavior
Test collection fails with `'health' not found in `markers` configuration option`.

## Affected Files
- `pytest.ini`
- `tests/health/test_health_monitoring.py`

## Requirements Impact
- Health monitoring and validation requirements
- System health check functionality
- Service availability monitoring

## Fix Required
Add the missing health marker to `pytest.ini`:
```ini
markers =
    unit: unit-level tests
    integration: integration-level tests
    health: health monitoring and validation tests
    # ... other existing markers
```

## Testing Guide Compliance
- **Violation**: Test configuration does not support all required test categories
- **Impact**: Prevents execution of health requirement validation tests
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Health testing is important for system validation
