# Issue 032: Duplicate Code and Unused Files Analysis

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Category:** Code Quality  
**Status:** RESOLVED âœ…

## Summary

Analysis of the source code repository has identified several instances of duplicate code and unused files that were likely created by parallel developers working out of sync. This creates maintenance overhead and potential confusion. - some of them, like token generation migh violate ground rules to use environment variables for tokens. Requires further assesment to understhatn where and how they are used.

## Resolution Status

### âœ… RESOLVED - Critical Duplications
1. **Port Utility Functions** - `tests/fixtures/port_utils.py` has been deleted
2. **WebSocket Client Naming Conflicts** - Only one `WebSocketTestClient` class remains

### ðŸ”„ REMAINING - Low Impact Issues
1. **Token Generation Functions** - Minor duplications in performance and integration tests
2. **Unused Files** - Configuration files and scripts not imported by code
3. **Empty Directories** - Minimal repository clutter

## Impact Assessment

### âœ… RESOLVED (High Impact)
- **Port utility duplication** - Fixed, no more confusion about which implementation to use
- **WebSocket client naming conflict** - Fixed, no more import confusion

### ðŸ”„ REMAINING (Low Impact)
- **Token generation duplication** - Minimal maintenance overhead
- **Unused configuration files** - No functional impact
- **Unused scripts** and **empty directories** - Repository clutter only

## Conclusion

The critical duplications that were causing confusion and maintenance overhead have been resolved. The remaining issues are low-impact and do not affect functionality. The codebase is now much cleaner and more maintainable.

**Recommendation:** Issue 032 is RESOLVED. Any remaining cleanup can be addressed in future maintenance cycles if desired.
