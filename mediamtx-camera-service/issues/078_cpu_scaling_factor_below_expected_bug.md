# Issue 078: CPU Scaling Factor Below Expected Range

**Status:** üêõ OPEN

## Summary

The CPU scaling test is failing because the scaling factor (0.47) is below the expected sub-linear range (0.6-1.0), indicating poor CPU utilization efficiency.

## Details

### Test Results
- **Expected Range:** 0.6-1.0 scaling factor (sub-linear scaling)
- **Actual Scaling Factor:** 0.47 (below min by 22%)
- **Test:** `test_linear_scaling_cpu_cores`
- **Failure:** Scaling factor below sub-linear range

### Root Cause Analysis
The system is not efficiently utilizing additional CPU cores, suggesting:

1. **GIL contention** - Global Interpreter Lock limiting true parallelism
2. **ThreadPoolExecutor overhead** - Context switching and thread management overhead
3. **Inefficient workload distribution** - Poor load balancing across cores
4. **CPU-bound task characteristics** - Tasks not suitable for parallelization

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** HIGH - Poor CPU utilization affects system performance
- **Scope:** Multi-core performance and scalability
- **User Impact:** Reduced performance under high load

## Investigation Required

### Performance Analysis
- [ ] Profile GIL contention patterns
- [ ] Analyze ThreadPoolExecutor overhead
- [ ] Investigate workload distribution efficiency
- [ ] Compare with multiprocessing alternatives

### Optimization Opportunities
- [ ] Consider multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks
- [ ] Optimize thread pool sizing and management
- [ ] Reduce GIL contention through async operations
- [ ] Implement better load balancing strategies

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CPU scaling factor within 0.6-1.0 range
- [ ] Improved multi-core utilization
- [ ] Reduced GIL contention
- [ ] Better workload distribution
