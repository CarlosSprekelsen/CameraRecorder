# Issue 079: Memory Scaling Coefficient of Variation Too High

**Status:** üêõ OPEN  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Type:** Performance Bug  
**Created:** 2025-01-15

## Summary

The memory scaling test is failing because the coefficient of variation (CV: 2.25) exceeds the expected threshold (CV < 1.0), indicating inconsistent memory usage patterns across different connection loads.

## Details

### Test Results
- **Expected Threshold:** CV < 1.0 (consistent memory scaling)
- **Actual CV:** 2.25 (exceeds threshold by 125%)
- **Test:** `test_memory_scaling_active_connections`
- **Failure:** Memory scaling not consistent

### Root Cause Analysis
The high coefficient of variation suggests inconsistent memory usage patterns:

1. **Variable memory allocation** - Inconsistent memory usage per connection
2. **Memory fragmentation** - Poor memory allocation patterns
3. **Garbage collection impact** - Irregular memory cleanup affecting measurements
4. **Connection overhead variation** - Different connection types using different memory amounts

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** MEDIUM - Inconsistent memory usage affects predictability
- **Scope:** Memory management and connection handling
- **User Impact:** Unpredictable memory usage patterns

## Investigation Required

### Performance Analysis
- [ ] Profile memory allocation patterns
- [ ] Analyze garbage collection impact
- [ ] Investigate connection memory overhead
- [ ] Compare memory usage across different connection types

### Optimization Opportunities
- [ ] Implement memory pooling for connections
- [ ] Optimize garbage collection frequency
- [ ] Standardize connection memory allocation
- [ ] Reduce memory fragmentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Coefficient of variation below 1.0
- [ ] Consistent memory usage patterns
- [ ] Predictable memory scaling
- [ ] Optimized memory allocation
