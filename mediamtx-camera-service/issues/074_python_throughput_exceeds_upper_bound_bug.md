# Issue 074: Python Throughput Exceeds Upper Bound

**Status:** üêõ OPEN  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Type:** Performance Bug

## Summary

The Python throughput validation test is failing because the actual throughput (13,244.61 req/s) significantly exceeds the expected range (50-500 req/s). This indicates the performance targets are too conservative and need adjustment.

## Details

### Test Results
- **Expected Range:** 50-500 requests/second
- **Actual Throughput:** 13,244.61 requests/second
- **Test:** `test_python_throughput_validation`
- **Failure:** Throughput exceeds maximum threshold by 26x

### Root Cause Analysis
The test was designed with artificial delays removed, revealing that Python with ThreadPoolExecutor can achieve much higher throughput than expected:

1. **No artificial delays** - Test measures pure Python performance
2. **Efficient ThreadPoolExecutor** - Minimal overhead for simple operations
3. **Conservative targets** - Performance requirements were set too low
4. **System capability** - Hardware can support much higher throughput

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** LOW - System performing better than expected
- **Scope:** Performance requirements need revision
- **User Impact:** Positive - System can handle higher load than designed

## Investigation Required

### Performance Analysis
- [ ] Validate test methodology is correct
- [ ] Confirm no measurement errors
- [ ] Compare with real-world API performance
- [ ] Assess if targets should be adjusted

### Requirements Review
- [ ] Review performance requirements document
- [ ] Update realistic performance targets
- [ ] Consider real-world API overhead
- [ ] Align with actual system capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance targets updated to realistic values
- [ ] Test passes with adjusted expectations
- [ ] Requirements document reflects actual capabilities
- [ ] No artificial performance limitations
