# Issue 075: API Operations Throughput Range Issues

**Status:** üêõ OPEN  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Type:** Performance Bug  
**Created:** 2025-01-15

## Summary

Multiple API operations are exceeding the expected throughput range (100-1000 ops/s), indicating the performance targets are too conservative for the current system capabilities.

## Details

### Test Results
- **Expected Range:** 100-1000 operations/second
- **Actual Results:**
  - `get_camera_list`: 1,887.32 ops/s (exceeds max by 89%)
  - `get_camera_status`: 3,921.57 ops/s (exceeds max by 292%)
  - `take_snapshot`: 395.30 ops/s (within range)
  - `start_recording`: 980.39 ops/s (within range)
  - `stop_recording`: 980.39 ops/s (within range)
  - `get_metrics`: 1,960.78 ops/s (exceeds max by 96%)
  - `list_recordings`: 653.59 ops/s (within range)
  - `list_snapshots`: 653.59 ops/s (within range)

### Root Cause Analysis
The test reveals that simple API operations (status queries, metrics) can achieve much higher throughput than expected:

1. **Simple operations** - Status queries and metrics have minimal processing overhead
2. **Conservative targets** - Performance requirements set too low for simple operations
3. **Efficient simulation** - Test operations don't include real I/O overhead
4. **System capability** - Hardware can support higher throughput for lightweight operations

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** LOW - System performing better than expected
- **Scope:** Performance requirements need adjustment
- **User Impact:** Positive - System can handle higher query load

## Investigation Required

### Performance Analysis
- [ ] Validate test simulation accuracy
- [ ] Compare with real API endpoint performance
- [ ] Assess if targets should be operation-specific
- [ ] Consider real-world I/O and processing overhead

### Requirements Review
- [ ] Update performance targets by operation type
- [ ] Consider different ranges for simple vs complex operations
- [ ] Align with actual system capabilities
- [ ] Document realistic performance expectations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance targets updated to realistic values
- [ ] Different ranges for different operation types
- [ ] Test passes with adjusted expectations
- [ ] Requirements document reflects actual capabilities
