# Bug Report: Authentication System Failure - Critical Blocking Issue

## Summary
The authentication system is completely failing to initialize, causing 90% of integration and performance tests to fail with "Authentication failed" errors. This is a critical blocking issue preventing any meaningful test execution.

## Severity
**CRITICAL** - Blocks all integration testing and performance validation.

## Root Cause
API key storage permission denied: `[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/opt/camera-service/keys'`

## Impact Assessment
- **Integration Tests**: 100% failure rate due to authentication unavailability
- **Performance Tests**: 100% failure rate due to authentication unavailability  
- **Security Tests**: Mixed results (some pass, some fail due to missing methods)
- **Unit Tests**: Mostly unaffected

## Test Results Analysis
From latest test run:
- **Total Tests**: ~150+ tests
- **Passed**: ~30 tests (20%)
- **Failed**: ~120 tests (80%)
- **Skipped**: 7 tests (5%)

## Failed Test Categories
1. **Integration Tests**: All failing with "Authentication failed"
2. **Performance Tests**: All failing with "Authentication failed"
3. **Security Tests**: Some failing due to missing `call_method` attribute
4. **Service Manager Tests**: Port binding conflicts

## Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix API Key Storage Permissions**: Create `/opt/camera-service/keys` with proper permissions
2. **Fix Missing Test Methods**: Add `call_method` to `WebSocketAuthTestClient`
3. **Resolve Port Conflicts**: Implement proper port management for tests
4. **Fix Performance Test Authentication**: Ensure performance tests can authenticate

## Status
**BLOCKING** - Must be resolved before any meaningful testing can proceed.
