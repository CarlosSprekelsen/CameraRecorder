# Issue 023: Test Import Error - Missing Performance Module

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Test Infrastructure
**Status:** OPEN
**Created:** August 21, 2025
**Discovered By:** Test Suite Execution

## Description
Unit tests are failing due to an import error where the `tests.performance.test_performance_pytest` module cannot be found. This prevents proper test execution and validation.

## Error Details
**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tests.performance.test_performance_pytest'`
**Location:** `tests/unit/test_all_requirements.py:26`
**Test:** `test_all_requirements.py` (import time)
**Root Cause:** Missing or incorrectly named performance test module

## Ground Truth Analysis
### API Documentation Evidence
**`docs/api/json-rpc-methods.md`** defines the public API as JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket:
- Tests should validate **API behavior**, not depend on missing modules
- Test infrastructure should be **self-contained and reliable**

### Architecture Evidence
**`docs/architecture/overview.md`** shows the system architecture:
- Tests should validate **component interfaces**, not depend on missing dependencies
- Test infrastructure should be **properly organized and maintained**

### Requirements Evidence
**`docs/requirements/*.md`** contains no references to missing modules:
- Requirements focus on **functional behavior**
- Tests should validate **business logic**, not missing dependencies

## Current Test Code (INCORRECT)
```python
# Importing a module that doesn't exist
from ..performance.test_performance_pytest import TestPerformanceRequirements as TestPerformancePytest, PerformanceRequirementsValidator as PerformancePytestValidator
```

## Correct Test Approach (Based on Ground Truth)
```python
# Either create the missing module or remove the import
# Option 1: Create the missing module
# Option 2: Remove the import and use existing performance tests
# Option 3: Use conditional import
try:
    from ..performance.test_performance_pytest import TestPerformanceRequirements
except ImportError:
    # Use alternative or skip the test
    pass
```

## Impact
- **Test Reliability:** Tests fail due to missing dependencies
- **Test Infrastructure:** Missing validation of requirements
- **API Compliance:** Tests don't validate the actual functionality
- **Maintenance:** Tests break due to missing modules

## Affected Test Files
- `tests/unit/test_all_requirements.py` - Import error prevents execution

## Root Cause
The test was designed to import a module that doesn't exist in the current test structure. This violates the principle that test infrastructure should be self-contained and properly organized.

## Proposed Solution
1. **Create the missing performance module** if it's needed
2. **Remove the import** if the module is not required
3. **Use conditional imports** for optional dependencies
4. **Reorganize test structure** to match actual module layout
5. **Focus on functional validation**, not missing dependencies

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All imports resolve correctly
- [ ] Tests use existing and available modules
- [ ] Tests validate functional requirements, not missing dependencies
- [ ] No ImportError exceptions during test execution
- [ ] Test infrastructure is self-contained

## Implementation Notes
- Test infrastructure should be **self-contained**
- Use **existing modules** for validation
- **Conditional imports** for optional dependencies
- Focus on **functional validation**

## Ground Truth Compliance
- ✅ **API Documentation**: Tests will validate documented behavior
- ✅ **Architecture**: Tests will validate component interfaces
- ✅ **Requirements**: Tests will validate functional requirements

## Testing
- Verify all imports resolve correctly
- Confirm no ImportError exceptions occur
- Validate functional requirements are tested
- Ensure test infrastructure is self-contained
