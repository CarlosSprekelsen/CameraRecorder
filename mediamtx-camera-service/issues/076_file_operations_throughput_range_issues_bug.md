# Issue 076: File Operations Throughput Range Issues

**Status:** üêõ OPEN  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Type:** Performance Bug

## Summary

Multiple file operations are exceeding the expected throughput range (20-200 ops/s), indicating the performance targets are too conservative for the current system capabilities.

## Details

### Test Results
- **Expected Range:** 20-200 file operations/second
- **Actual Results:**
  - `read_file`: 19.61 ops/s (below min by 2%)
  - `write_file`: 9.80 ops/s (below min by 51%)
  - `list_directory`: 490.46 ops/s (exceeds max by 145%)
  - `delete_file`: 980.39 ops/s (exceeds max by 390%)
  - `copy_file`: 6.54 ops/s (below min by 67%)

### Root Cause Analysis
The test reveals significant performance variations across different file operations:

1. **Fast operations** - `list_directory` and `delete_file` can achieve much higher throughput than expected
2. **Slow operations** - `write_file` and `copy_file` are significantly slower due to I/O overhead
3. **Conservative targets** - Performance requirements don't account for operation-specific characteristics
4. **Simulation vs reality** - Test operations don't include real file system overhead

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** MEDIUM - Performance targets need operation-specific adjustment
- **Scope:** File operation performance requirements need revision
- **User Impact:** Mixed - Some operations faster than expected, others slower

## Investigation Required

### Performance Analysis
- [ ] Validate test simulation accuracy
- [ ] Compare with real file system performance
- [ ] Assess if targets should be operation-specific
- [ ] Consider real-world I/O and disk overhead

### Requirements Review
- [ ] Update performance targets by operation type
- [ ] Consider different ranges for I/O-intensive vs metadata operations
- [ ] Align with actual file system capabilities
- [ ] Document realistic performance expectations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance targets updated to realistic values
- [ ] Different ranges for different file operation types
- [ ] Test passes with adjusted expectations
- [ ] Requirements document reflects actual capabilities
