# Issue 073: Throughput Validation Below Target

**Status:** üêõ OPEN  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Type:** Performance Bug  
**Created:** 2025-01-15

## Summary

The throughput validation test is failing because the actual throughput (98.13 req/s) is below the expected Python range (100-200 req/s). This indicates a real performance issue that needs investigation.

## Details

### Test Results
- **Expected Range:** 100-200 requests/second
- **Actual Throughput:** 98.13 requests/second
- **Test:** `test_throughput_validation`
- **Failure:** Throughput below minimum threshold

### Root Cause Analysis
The test uses `time.sleep(0.01)` which artificially limits throughput to ~100 req/s. However, the actual achieved throughput is slightly below this theoretical limit, suggesting:

1. **ThreadPoolExecutor overhead** - Context switching and thread management overhead
2. **Python GIL impact** - Global Interpreter Lock limiting true parallelism
3. **System resource contention** - CPU or memory constraints

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** MEDIUM - Performance degradation affects system responsiveness
- **Scope:** All API operations affected
- **User Impact:** Slower response times for concurrent requests

## Investigation Required

### Performance Analysis
- [ ] Profile ThreadPoolExecutor overhead
- [ ] Measure GIL contention impact
- [ ] Analyze system resource utilization during test
- [ ] Compare with baseline Python performance benchmarks

### Optimization Opportunities
- [ ] Investigate async/await alternatives to ThreadPoolExecutor
- [ ] Consider multiprocessing for CPU-bound operations
- [ ] Optimize thread pool sizing
- [ ] Reduce context switching overhead

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Throughput meets or exceeds 100 req/s minimum
- [ ] Performance is consistent across multiple test runs
- [ ] No regression in other performance metrics
- [ ] Root cause identified and documented
