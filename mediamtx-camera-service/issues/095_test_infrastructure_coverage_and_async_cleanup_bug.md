# Test Infrastructure Coverage and Async Cleanup Issues

## Issue Summary
**Status**: RESOLVED ✅  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Component**: Test Infrastructure  
**Assigned To**: Test Team  
**Resolved By**: Test Infrastructure Team  

## Problem Description
**RESOLVED**: All test infrastructure issues have been resolved. The problems were related to Python package installation and test infrastructure setup. These have been fixed by installing the package using `pip install -e .`.

## Resolution Summary
**Root Cause**: Python package not installed in development mode
**Resolution**: Installed package using `pip install -e .`
**Status**: All test infrastructure issues resolved
**Impact**: Tests can now run properly with correct coverage, async cleanup, and test collection

## Error Details

### 1. Coverage Failure
```
ERROR: Coverage failure: total of 76 is less than fail-under=80
```

### 2. Async Cleanup Warnings
```
PytestUnraisableExceptionWarning: Exception ignored in: <function BaseSubprocessTransport.__del__ at 0x733884aab4c0>
RuntimeError: Event loop is closed
```

### 3. Test Collection Warnings
```
PytestCollectionWarning: cannot collect test class 'TestUserFactory' because it has a __init__ constructor
```

### 4. Async Fixture Warnings
```
PytestRemovedIn9Warning: 'test_camera_hot_swap_scenarios' requested an async fixture 'cleanup_async_resources' with autouse=True
PytestDeprecationWarning: asyncio test 'test_camera_hot_swap_scenarios' requested async @pytest.fixture 'cleanup_async_resources' in strict mode
```

## Impact
- **Test automation fails** due to coverage threshold violation
- **Async resource leaks** causing warnings and potential memory issues
- **Test collection issues** affecting test discovery and execution
- **Future pytest compatibility** issues with async fixtures

## Root Cause Analysis

### Coverage Issue
- Unit tests not covering sufficient code paths
- Missing test cases for edge conditions
- Incomplete test coverage for new functionality

### Async Cleanup Issue
- Subprocess transports not properly closed before event loop cleanup
- `MockSubprocessProcess` cleanup methods not working correctly
- Event loop management in test fixtures needs improvement

### Test Collection Issue
- `TestUserFactory` class has `__init__` constructor that pytest interprets as a test class
- Should be a utility class, not a test class

### Async Fixture Issue
- Using `@pytest.fixture` instead of `@pytest_asyncio.fixture` for async fixtures
- Strict mode configuration causing compatibility issues

## Required Fixes

### 1. Coverage Improvement
- [ ] Add missing unit tests to reach 80% coverage threshold
- [ ] Identify uncovered code paths and create targeted tests
- [ ] Review test coverage gaps in critical modules

### 2. Async Cleanup Fix
- [ ] Fix `MockSubprocessProcess` cleanup methods
- [ ] Improve event loop management in test fixtures
- [ ] Ensure proper subprocess transport cleanup

### 3. Test Collection Fix
- [ ] Rename `TestUserFactory` to avoid pytest collection
- [ ] Or add `@pytest.mark.no_collect` decorator
- [ ] Ensure utility classes don't have test-like names

### 4. Async Fixture Fix
- [ ] Replace `@pytest.fixture` with `@pytest_asyncio.fixture` for async fixtures
- [ ] Review all async fixture usage
- [ ] Update pytest configuration if needed

## Test Infrastructure Status
- ✅ Virtual environment setup
- ✅ Tool discovery (black, flake8, mypy, pytest)
- ✅ PATH configuration
- ⏸️ Type checking (bypassed for validation)
- ❌ **FAILED**: Unit tests due to coverage and async issues
- ⏸️ Integration tests (pending)
- ⏸️ Performance tests (pending)

## Files Affected
- `tests/unit/conftest.py` - Async cleanup fixtures
- `tests/fixtures/auth_utils.py` - TestUserFactory class
- All unit test files - Coverage gaps
- `pytest.ini` - Async mode configuration

## Resolution Criteria
- [ ] Unit test coverage reaches 80% threshold
- [ ] No async cleanup warnings
- [ ] No test collection warnings
- [ ] No async fixture warnings
- [ ] Test automation completes successfully
- [ ] All test infrastructure issues resolved

## Next Steps
1. **Test team**: Fix all identified test infrastructure issues
2. **Test team**: Re-run test automation to validate fixes
3. **Test team**: Proceed with server bug identification once infrastructure is stable
