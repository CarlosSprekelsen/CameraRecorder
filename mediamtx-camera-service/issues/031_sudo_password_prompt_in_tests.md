# Bug Report: Sudo password prompt in tests

**Issue ID:** 031  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** OPEN  
**Date:** 2025-01-06  
**Reporter:** IV&V Team  

## Summary
Tests are prompting for sudo password during execution, which can cause test failures and interrupt automated test runs. This occurs when tests attempt to perform operations that require elevated privileges.

## Description
When running the test suite, the following output appears:

```
sudo: a password is required
```

This indicates that tests are attempting to use sudo without proper configuration for passwordless execution or without using the appropriate test environment setup.

## Root Cause
Tests are calling system commands that require elevated privileges (sudo) without proper configuration for automated test execution.

## Impact
- Test execution can be interrupted by password prompts
- Automated test runs may fail or hang
- Inconsistent test behavior across different environments
- Violates testing guide requirements for automated test execution

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run the test suite: `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v`
2. Observe sudo password prompts during test execution

## Expected Behavior
Tests should either:
- Not require sudo privileges
- Be properly configured for passwordless sudo execution
- Use appropriate test environment setup

## Actual Behavior
Tests prompt for sudo password during execution.

## Affected Files
- Test files that use system commands requiring elevated privileges
- Test configuration and setup scripts

## Requirements Impact
- Automated test execution requirements
- Test environment setup and configuration
- System integration testing

## Fix Required
1. Review tests that use sudo and determine if elevated privileges are actually required
2. Configure sudo for passwordless execution in test environment
3. Use alternative approaches that don't require elevated privileges
4. Add proper test environment setup documentation

## Testing Guide Compliance
- **Violation**: Tests require manual intervention during execution
- **Impact**: Prevents fully automated test execution
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Automated test execution is important for CI/CD pipelines
