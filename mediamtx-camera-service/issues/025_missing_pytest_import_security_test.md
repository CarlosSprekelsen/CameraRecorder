# Bug Report: Missing pytest import in security test file

**Issue ID:** 025  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** OPEN  
**Date:** 2025-01-06  
**Reporter:** IV&V Team  

## Summary
The security test file `tests/security/test_security_concepts.py` is missing the required `pytest` import, causing a `NameError: name 'pytest' is not defined` during test collection.

## Description
When running the test suite, the following error occurs during test collection:

```
ERROR collecting tests/security/test_security_concepts.py
tests/security/test_security_concepts.py:79: in <module>
    @pytest.mark.security
E   NameError: name 'pytest' is not defined
```

## Root Cause
The file `tests/security/test_security_concepts.py` uses `@pytest.mark.security` decorator on line 79 but does not import the `pytest` module.

## Impact
- Test collection fails for the entire security test suite
- Prevents execution of security-related tests
- Blocks comprehensive test coverage validation
- Violates testing guide requirements for proper test organization

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run the test suite: `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v`
2. Observe test collection error for `tests/security/test_security_concepts.py`

## Expected Behavior
The security test file should import pytest and execute successfully.

## Actual Behavior
Test collection fails with `NameError: name 'pytest' is not defined`.

## Affected Files
- `tests/security/test_security_concepts.py`

## Requirements Impact
- **REQ-SEC-001**: JWT token-based authentication for all API access
- **REQ-SEC-002**: Token Format: JSON Web Token (JWT) with standard claims
- **REQ-SEC-003**: Token Expiration: Configurable expiration time (default: 24 hours)
- **REQ-SEC-004**: Token Refresh: Support for token refresh mechanism
- **REQ-SEC-005**: Token Validation: Proper signature validation and claim verification

## Fix Required
Add the missing pytest import at the top of the file:
```python
import pytest
```

## Testing Guide Compliance
- **Violation**: Test file does not follow proper import structure
- **Impact**: Prevents execution of security requirement validation tests
- **Priority**: HIGH - Security testing is critical for system validation
