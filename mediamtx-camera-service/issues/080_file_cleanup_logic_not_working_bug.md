# Issue 080: File Cleanup Logic Not Working Bug

**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** API Implementation Bug  
**Created:** 2025-01-16  
**Discovered By:** Test Suite (Issue 070 Resolution)  

## Description

The `cleanup_old_files` API method is not actually deleting old files despite the API returning success. This is a real implementation bug in the file cleanup logic.

## Root Cause Analysis

After fixing the test infrastructure in Issue 070, the tests revealed that the cleanup functionality is not working as expected:

### Test Evidence:
- **Test**: `test_cleanup_old_files_success`
- **Expected**: `files_deleted >= 3` (files are 48 hours old, retention policy is 1 day)
- **Actual**: `files_deleted = 0`
- **API Response**: Success with `cleanup_executed: true` but no files actually deleted

### API Behavior:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "cleanup_executed": true,
    "files_deleted": 0,  // Should be >= 3
    "space_freed": 0,    // Should be > 0
    "message": "Cleanup completed successfully (placeholder implementation)"
  },
  "id": 18
}
```

## Impact Assessment

**Severity**: HIGH
- **File Management**: Core file retention functionality not working
- **Storage Management**: Old files not being cleaned up automatically
- **System Reliability**: Storage space will accumulate over time
- **Compliance**: File retention policies not being enforced

## Technical Analysis

### Expected Behavior:
1. Files created 48 hours ago should be detected as "old"
2. Retention policy set to 1 day should trigger deletion
3. API should return actual number of files deleted
4. Storage space should be freed

### Actual Behavior:
1. Files are not being detected as "old" (timing issue?)
2. Cleanup logic is not finding files to delete
3. API returns success but no actual cleanup occurs
4. Placeholder implementation message suggests incomplete implementation

## Investigation Required

### File Detection Issues:
1. **File Age Calculation**: Check if file modification times are being read correctly
2. **Time Comparison**: Verify age comparison logic against retention policy
3. **File Discovery**: Ensure cleanup finds all files in recordings/snapshots directories
4. **Path Resolution**: Check if file paths are being resolved correctly

### Cleanup Logic Issues:
1. **Retention Policy**: Verify retention policy is being applied correctly
2. **File Filtering**: Check if files are being filtered by age/size properly
3. **Deletion Logic**: Ensure actual file deletion is being performed
4. **Error Handling**: Check if errors are being silently ignored

### Implementation Issues:
1. **Placeholder Code**: The message suggests this might be placeholder implementation
2. **File System Operations**: Verify file system operations are working
3. **Permissions**: Check if the service has proper permissions to delete files
4. **Directory Access**: Ensure directories are accessible for cleanup

## Recommended Resolution

### Phase 1: Investigation
1. **Log Analysis**: Add detailed logging to cleanup process
2. **File Discovery**: Verify all files are being discovered
3. **Age Calculation**: Debug file age calculation logic
4. **Policy Application**: Verify retention policy application

### Phase 2: Implementation Fix
1. **File Detection**: Fix file age detection logic
2. **Cleanup Logic**: Implement proper file deletion
3. **Error Handling**: Add proper error handling and reporting
4. **Validation**: Add validation for cleanup results

### Phase 3: Testing
1. **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests for cleanup logic
2. **Integration Tests**: Verify cleanup works in real scenarios
3. **Edge Cases**: Test edge cases (no files, all files old, etc.)
4. **Performance**: Test cleanup performance with large numbers of files

## Files to Investigate

### High Priority:
- `src/websocket_server/server.py` - `cleanup_old_files` method implementation
- `src/camera_service/file_management.py` - File management utilities (if exists)
- `src/camera_service/retention_policy.py` - Retention policy logic (if exists)

### Medium Priority:
- Any file system utility modules
- Configuration files for retention policies
- Logging configuration for debugging

## Test Evidence

### Failing Test:
```python
async def test_cleanup_old_files_success(self, retention_setup):
    # Create test files that are 48 hours old
    retention_setup.create_test_files(age_hours=48, count=3)
    
    # Set retention policy to 1 day
    await retention_setup.websocket_client.send_request(
        "set_retention_policy",
        {
            "policy_type": "age",
            "max_age_days": 1,
            "enabled": True
        }
    )
    
    # Run cleanup
    response = await retention_setup.websocket_client.send_request(
        "cleanup_old_files",
        {}
    )
    
    # This assertion fails:
    assert response["result"]["files_deleted"] >= 3  # Actual: 0
```

## Verification Steps

1. **File Creation**: Verify test files are created with correct timestamps
2. **Policy Setting**: Confirm retention policy is set correctly
3. **Cleanup Execution**: Check if cleanup method is being called
4. **File Discovery**: Verify files are being found by cleanup logic
5. **Age Calculation**: Debug file age calculation
6. **Deletion**: Check if actual file deletion occurs
7. **Response**: Verify API response reflects actual cleanup results

## Conclusion

This is a critical bug in the file cleanup implementation. The API is returning success but not actually performing the cleanup operations. This needs immediate investigation and fix to ensure proper file retention policy enforcement.

**Next Steps:** Investigate the `cleanup_old_files` method implementation and fix the file detection and deletion logic.
