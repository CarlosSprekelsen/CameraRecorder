# Issue 022: Test NameError - websocket_server Variable Undefined

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Test Infrastructure
**Status:** OPEN
**Created:** August 21, 2025
**Discovered By:** Test Suite Execution

## Description
Performance tests are failing due to a NameError where the `websocket_server` variable is not defined in the test scope. This prevents proper test execution and validation.

## Error Details
**Error:** `NameError: name 'websocket_server' is not defined`
**Location:** `tests/performance/test_scalability_validation.py:324`
**Test:** `test_scalability_validation_suite`
**Root Cause:** Variable scope issue in test cleanup code

## Ground Truth Analysis
### API Documentation Evidence
**`docs/api/json-rpc-methods.md`** defines the public API as JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket:
- Tests should validate **API performance**, not internal variable scoping
- Performance tests should use **proper resource management**

### Architecture Evidence
**`docs/architecture/overview.md`** shows the system architecture:
- Tests should validate **system performance**, not implementation details
- Performance tests should have **proper cleanup procedures**

### Requirements Evidence
**`docs/requirements/performance-requirements.md`** contains performance requirements:
- Tests should validate **performance metrics**, not variable scoping
- Performance tests should be **reliable and repeatable**

## Current Test Code (INCORRECT)
```python
# Variable is not defined in this scope
await websocket_server.stop()  # WRONG: websocket_server not defined
```

## Correct Test Approach (Based on Ground Truth)
```python
# Ensure proper variable scoping and resource management
if 'websocket_server' in locals():
    await websocket_server.stop()
# Or use proper context management
async with WebSocketServer() as server:
    # Test code here
```

## Impact
- **Test Reliability:** Tests fail due to variable scoping issues
- **Performance Testing:** Missing validation of system performance
- **API Compliance:** Tests don't validate the actual performance characteristics
- **Maintenance:** Tests break due to implementation details

## Affected Test Files
- `tests/performance/test_scalability_validation.py` - NameError in cleanup

## Root Cause
The test was designed with improper variable scoping where a variable is referenced outside its defined scope. This violates the principle that tests should have proper resource management and variable scoping.

## Proposed Solution
1. **Fix variable scoping** in test methods
2. **Use proper resource management** with context managers
3. **Ensure proper cleanup** procedures
4. **Validate variable existence** before use
5. **Focus on performance validation**, not implementation details

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All variables are properly scoped
- [ ] Tests use proper resource management
- [ ] Tests validate performance metrics, not implementation details
- [ ] No NameError exceptions during test execution
- [ ] Tests have proper cleanup procedures

## Implementation Notes
- Performance tests should validate **system performance**
- Use **proper resource management** with context managers
- **Validate variable existence** before use
- Focus on **performance metrics validation**

## Ground Truth Compliance
- ✅ **API Documentation**: Tests will validate documented performance
- ✅ **Architecture**: Tests will validate system performance
- ✅ **Requirements**: Tests will validate performance requirements

## Testing
- Verify all variables are properly scoped
- Confirm no NameError exceptions occur
- Validate performance metrics are tested
- Ensure proper resource cleanup
