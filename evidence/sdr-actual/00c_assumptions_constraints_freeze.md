# Assumptions and Constraints Freeze
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-15  
**Role:** Project Manager  
**SDR Phase:** Phase 0 - Requirements Baseline

## Purpose
Freeze assumptions and constraints to prevent scope drift during SDR feasibility validation. Establish clear boundaries and change control requirements to maintain focus on design feasibility demonstration.

## Change Control Rule
**PM WAIVER REQUIRED**: Any deviation from frozen assumptions, constraints, or non-goals requires explicit Project Manager waiver with justification and impact assessment.
