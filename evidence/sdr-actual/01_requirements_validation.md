## Requirement Dependencies and Conflicts

### Dependency Analysis

#### Primary Dependencies Identified
1. **SR.1 → Functional Requirements Document**: SR.1 requires reference to undefined functional requirements
2. **SR.2 → VR.2 Completion**: Technology validation depends on VR.2.1-VR.2.3
3. **SR.3 → VR.1 + ES2.1**: Integration validation depends on architecture feasibility validation
4. **SR.4 → RR Framework**: Risk mitigation depends on risk assessment completion
5. **VR.1.2 → Performance Targets**: Depends on architecture overview performance specifications
6. **All Evidence Requirements → Validation Completion**: ER requirements depend on corresponding VR completion

#### Cross-Dependencies
- **VR.1.1 ↔ VR.2.1**: Component integration depends on MediaMTX integration
- **VR.2.2 ↔ VR.1.2**: Python/Go integration affects performance feasibility
- **VR.3.1 ↔ VR.3.2**: Authentication design affects system hardening

### Conflict Analysis

#### ✅ **NO CRITICAL CONFLICTS IDENTIFIED**

**Validation Method**: Cross-reference analysis of all 24 requirements shows:
- No contradictory acceptance criteria
- No conflicting validation methods
- No incompatible success criteria
- Compatible risk tolerance levels
- Consistent quality standards

#### Minor Tension Points (Manageable)
1. **Performance vs Security**: VR.1.2 performance requirements may conflict with VR.3.2 security hardening
   - **Resolution**: Define acceptable performance impact of security measures
2. **Rapid Validation vs Thorough Testing**: 5-day execution plan vs comprehensive validation requirements
   - **Resolution**: Prioritize critical path validation within timeline constraints

## Validation Loop Results

### Issues Requiring Stakeholder Clarification

#### STOP Issue 1: SR.1 Functional Requirements Scope
**Problem**: SR.1 references undefined "functional requirements"
**Required Action**: Stakeholder must provide:
- Specific functional requirements document reference
- Quantitative "technical feasibility" criteria
- Measurable "supports all" validation method

**Impact**: Blocks SR.1 validation until resolved

#### STOP Issue 2: SR.5 Implementation Readiness Criteria
**Problem**: SR.5 uses subjective acceptance criteria
**Required Action**: Stakeholder must define:
- Objective readiness measurement criteria
- Deliverable completeness requirements
- Team capability validation methods

**Impact**: Blocks SR.5 validation until resolved

### Iteration Requirements

#### Performance Criteria Refinement
**Issue**: VR.2.2 "acceptable performance" needs quantification
**Resolution**: Define specific performance thresholds for Python/Go integration
**Status**: Minor issue - can proceed with general performance targets

#### Risk Assessment Timing
**Issue**: RR framework requires early risk identification for effective mitigation
**Resolution**: Move risk assessment activities to Phase 1 parallel execution
**Status**: Process improvement - does not block requirements

### Gate Readiness Assessment

#### ✅ **ACCEPTABLE WITH CLARIFICATION**
**Rationale**: 
- 92% of requirements are complete and testable
- No critical conflicts identified
- All dependencies properly mapped
- Clear priority categorization established

#### Required Actions Before SDR Execution
1. **Resolve SR.1**: Define functional requirements scope and measurable feasibility criteria
2. **Resolve SR.5**: Establish objective implementation readiness criteria
3. **Refine Performance Criteria**: Quantify "acceptable performance" in VR.2.2

#### Recommendations
1. **Proceed with SDR Execution**: 22/24 requirements sufficient for meaningful validation
2. **Parallel Clarification**: Resolve SR.1 and SR.5 during Phase 1 execution
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Early risk assessment parallel to technical validation

## Conclusion

The SDR scope definition contains a comprehensive and largely complete requirements framework. With 92% of requirements validated as complete and testable, the document provides sufficient basis for SDR execution. The two identified issues (SR.1 and SR.5) require stakeholder clarification but do not prevent proceeding with the core validation activities.

**IV&V Assessment**: ✅ **APPROVED FOR EXECUTION WITH CLARIFICATION**

**Success Confirmation**: "Requirements framework validated as substantially complete and testable - 22 of 24 requirements approved, 2 requiring clarification, zero conflicts identified"

**Recommended Next Action**: Proceed with SDR execution while resolving identified clarification requirements in parallel.
