# STOP Comments for Follow-up

## Client-S1: PWA Icon Files ✅ RESOLVED
**File**: `public/manifest.json` and `vite.config.ts`
**Issue**: PWA manifest references icon files (`icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`) that don't exist
**Resolution**: 
- ✅ Generated placeholder icons: `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`
- ✅ Icons created with "MTX" text on blue background
- ✅ Icons integrated into manifest.json and vite.config.ts
- ✅ No STOP comments remain in PWA configuration files
