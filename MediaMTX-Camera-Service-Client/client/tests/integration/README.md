# Integration Testing Strategy

## Overview
Integration tests validate the complete system with real server components, focusing on:
- **Performance Testing**: Real WebSocket connections, file operations, streaming
- **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization, data validation
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Complete user journeys with real data
- **API Compliance**: Validation against authoritative JSON-RPC specification

## Test Categories

### 1. **Performance Integration Tests**
- WebSocket connection performance
- File upload/download performance
- Streaming performance under load
- Memory usage and cleanup
- Network resilience testing

### 2. **Security Integration Tests**
- Authentication flow validation
- Authorization boundary testing
- Data sanitization verification
- Session management testing
- API key validation

### 3. **API Compliance Tests**
- JSON-RPC 2.0 specification compliance
- Error handling validation
- Data structure validation
- Method parameter validation
- Response format validation

### 4. **End-to-End Workflow Tests**
- Complete recording workflow
- File management workflow
- Device management workflow
- User authentication workflow
- Error recovery workflows

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Real MediaMTX server deployed
- Test database with known data
- Network connectivity to server
- Performance monitoring tools

### Test Data Strategy
- **Controlled test data**: Known files, devices, users
- **Performance baselines**: Established metrics for comparison
- **Security test cases**: Malicious inputs, edge cases
- **Load test scenarios**: Concurrent users, large files

## Benefits Over Unit Tests

### **Real-World Validation**
- Tests actual network conditions
- Validates real server responses
- Tests performance under load
- Verifies security boundaries

### **Performance Insights**
- WebSocket connection latency
- File transfer speeds
- Memory usage patterns
- Network resilience

### **Security Validation**
- Real authentication flows
- Actual authorization checks
- Data validation in production-like environment
- Session management verification

### **API Compliance**
- Validates against real server implementation
- Tests actual JSON-RPC responses
- Verifies error handling
- Confirms data structure compliance

## Conclusion

Integration testing with real server provides:
- **Real-world validation** of system performance
- **Security verification** in production-like environment
- **Performance insights** for optimization
- **API compliance** validation against real server

This approach is more valuable than fixing unit test configuration issues and provides actionable insights for system optimization.
