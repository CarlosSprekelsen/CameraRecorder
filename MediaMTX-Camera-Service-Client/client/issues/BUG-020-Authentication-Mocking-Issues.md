# BUG-020: Authentication Mocking Issues

## Summary
Multiple page components (CameraPage, FilesPage, AboutPage, AdminPanel) are failing tests due to missing authentication mocking. Components are showing authentication error states instead of expected content.

## Affected Components
- **CameraPage**: Shows "Please log in to view camera devices" instead of camera management interface
- **FilesPage**: Shows "File service not initialized" error instead of file operations
- **AboutPage**: Shows "Server service not initialized" error instead of about information
- **AdminPanel**: Shows "Access denied. Admin privileges required" instead of admin interface

## Root Cause
The test helper `component-test-helper.ts` is not properly mocking authentication state for protected components. Components are checking authentication status and showing error states when not authenticated.

## Test Failures
```
● CameraPage Component › REQ-CAMERAPAGE-001: CameraPage renders camera management interface
  Unable to find an element with the text: Camera Management

● FilesPage Component › REQ-FILESPAGE-001: FilesPage renders file management interface  
  Unable to find an element with the text: File Management

● AboutPage Component › REQ-ABOUT-001: AboutPage renders information content
  Unable to find an element with the text: About

● AdminPanel Component › REQ-ADMIN-001: AdminPanel renders admin interface
  Unable to find an element with the text: System Management
```

## Expected Behavior
- Components should render their main content when properly authenticated
- Tests should mock authentication state to allow components to render normally
- Protected components should show their intended functionality, not authentication errors

## Priority
**HIGH** - Blocks multiple page component tests from passing

**Authentication/Authorization Team**

## Files to Fix
- `tests/utils/component-test-helper.ts` - Add authentication mocking
- `tests/unit/components/pages/CameraPage.test.tsx`
- `tests/unit/components/pages/FilesPage.test.tsx` 
- `tests/unit/components/pages/AboutPage.test.tsx`
- `tests/unit/components/organisms/AdminPanel.test.tsx`
