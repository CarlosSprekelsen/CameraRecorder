# BUG-023: Service Logging Message Mismatches

## Summary
FileService and WebSocketService tests are failing due to mismatched logging message expectations. Tests expect specific log messages but services use different message formats.

## Affected Services
- **FileService**: 12 test failures due to logging message mismatches
- **WebSocketService**: 1 test failure due to parameter expectation mismatch

## Test Failures
```
● FileService Unit Tests › REQ-FILE-001: File listing with pagination
  Expected: "Listing recordings: limit=10, offset=0"
  Received: "FileService initialized", "list_recordings request", {"limit": 10, "offset": 0}

● WebSocketService › REQ-WS-002: IAPIClient method calls
  Expected: "test_method", undefined
  Received: "test_method"
```

## Root Cause
- Tests were written with expected log message formats that don't match actual service implementations
- Services use different logging patterns than what tests expect
- Parameter handling in WebSocket service doesn't match test expectations

## Expected Behavior
- Services should use consistent logging message formats
- Tests should expect the actual log messages generated by services
- Parameter handling should be consistent across services

## Priority
**MEDIUM** - Affects service test coverage and logging consistency

## Assignee
**Service Architecture Team**

## Files to Fix
- `tests/unit/services/file_service.test.ts` - Update logging expectations
- `tests/unit/services/websocket_service.test.ts` - Fix parameter expectations
- `src/services/file/FileService.ts` - Review logging consistency
- `src/services/websocket/WebSocketService.ts` - Review parameter handling
