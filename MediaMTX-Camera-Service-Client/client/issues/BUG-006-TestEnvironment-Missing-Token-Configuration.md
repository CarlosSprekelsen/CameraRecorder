# BUG-006: Test Environment Missing Token Configuration

## Summary
Test environment is missing required authentication tokens, causing test failures across multiple test files with error message "Missing environment token: ${tokenKey}. Run reinstall-with-tokens.sh to generate tokens."

## Type
Defect - Test Environment Configuration

## Priority
High

## Severity
Major

## Affected Component
- **Test Environment**: Test token configuration
- **Test Files**: Multiple page component tests
- **Environment Setup**: Authentication token management

## Environment
- **Version**: Current development branch
- **Test Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Environment**: Development test environment

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
2. Observe test failures across multiple test files
3. Check error messages for missing token references

## Expected Behavior
Test environment should have properly configured authentication tokens, allowing all tests to run without environment-related failures.

## Actual Behavior
Multiple test files fail with environment token errors, preventing proper test execution and validation of component functionality.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Code Location
Test environment configuration and token management

### Affected Test Files
1. `tests/unit/components/pages/FilesPage.test.tsx`
2. `tests/unit/components/pages/CameraPage.test.tsx`
3. Other page component tests (likely)

### Error Pattern
```javascript
Error: Missing environment token: ${tokenKey}. Run reinstall-with-tokens.sh to generate tokens.
```

### Test Execution Context
The error occurs at line 45 in multiple test files, suggesting a common environment setup or token validation mechanism that is failing across the test suite.

### Why This Occurred
The test environment was not properly configured with required authentication tokens, or the token generation script (`reinstall-with-tokens.sh`) was not executed during environment setup.

### Impact Assessment
- **Test Execution**: Multiple test files cannot execute properly
- **CI/CD**: Test suite cannot complete successfully
- **Development**: Developers cannot validate component functionality
- **Quality Assurance**: Component tests are not running, reducing confidence in code quality

## Test Evidence

### Failing Test Files
```
FAIL tests/unit/components/pages/FilesPage.test.tsx
  > 45 | throw new Error(`Missing environment token: ${tokenKey}. Run reinstall-with-tokens.sh to generate tokens.`);

FAIL tests/unit/components/pages/CameraPage.test.tsx
  > 45 | throw new Error(`Missing environment token: ${tokenKey}. Run reinstall-with-tokens.sh to generate tokens.`);
```

### Error Pattern Analysis
- Error occurs at line 45 in multiple files
- Error message references `${tokenKey}` variable
- Error message suggests running `reinstall-with-tokens.sh` script
- Pattern indicates systematic environment configuration issue

## Related Documentation
- **Environment Setup**: Test environment configuration documentation
- **Token Management**: Authentication token setup procedures
- **Script Reference**: `reinstall-with-tokens.sh` script

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All required authentication tokens are properly configured in test environment
2. All page component tests execute without environment token errors
3. Test suite can complete successfully without environment-related failures
4. Token configuration is documented and reproducible

## Proposed Fix

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Execute Token Generation Script**
   ```bash
   # Run the suggested script to generate tokens
   ./reinstall-with-tokens.sh
   ```

2. **Verify Token Configuration**
   - Check that generated tokens are properly placed in test environment
   - Verify token variables are accessible to test files
   - Confirm token format matches test expectations

3. **Update Test Environment Setup**
   - Ensure test environment setup includes token configuration
   - Add token validation to test setup procedures
   - Document token requirements for new developers

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Environment Validation**
   - Add environment validation to test setup
   - Provide clear error messages for missing configuration
   - Automate token generation in CI/CD pipeline

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Document token setup requirements
   - Provide step-by-step environment setup guide
   - Add troubleshooting section for token issues

## Verification Steps
1. Execute `reinstall-with-tokens.sh` script
2. Verify tokens are generated and placed correctly
3. Run unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
4. Confirm all page component tests pass
5. Verify no environment token errors remain

## Additional Notes
- This issue affects multiple test files, indicating a systematic environment problem
- The error message provides clear guidance on resolution (run token generation script)
- Environment configuration should be part of standard development setup procedures
- Token management should be automated to prevent future occurrences

## Attachments
- Test failure output: See test run from 2025-10-01
- Environment setup documentation: (to be referenced)
- Token generation script: `reinstall-with-tokens.sh`
- Affected test files: Multiple page component test files
