# BUG-017: DeviceService Method Missing - takeSnapshot

## Summary
Integration tests are failing because `DeviceService.takeSnapshot` method is not implemented, causing "deviceService.takeSnapshot is not a function" errors across multiple test suites.

## Impact
- **Multiple test failures** in authenticated functionality tests
- **Snapshot operations** completely broken
- **Permission testing** failing due to missing method
- **API contract validation** issues

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Missing Method Implementation
- Tests expect `deviceService.takeSnapshot()` method to exist
- Method is called but not implemented in `DeviceService` class
- Results in runtime TypeError: "deviceService.takeSnapshot is not a function"

### Evidence from Test Failures

#### Authenticated Functionality Tests
```
❌ Viewer permission test failed: expect(received).toContain(expected)
Expected substring: "permission"
Received string: "deviceService.takeSnapshot is not a function"
```

#### Real Functionality Tests  
```
content_test_snapshot: tester.deviceService.takeSnapshot is not a function
```

#### Permission Testing Failures
```
✅ Viewer correctly blocked from taking snapshot: deviceService.takeSnapshot is not a function
```

### Architecture Compliance Check
**Ground Truth Reference**: `docs/architecture/client-architechture.md`

1. **Missing API Method**: `takeSnapshot` not implemented in `DeviceService`
2. **JSON-RPC Compliance**: Method should exist per API specification
3. **Permission Validation**: Cannot test viewer vs operator permissions without method

## Affected Test Suites
- `authenticated_functionality.test.ts`: Snapshot operations failing
- `real_functionality.test.ts`: Snapshot functionality tests failing  
- `notification_security.test.ts`: Permission validation failing

## Expected Behavior
```typescript
// DeviceService should have:
class DeviceService extends BaseService {
  async takeSnapshot(device: string): Promise<SnapshotResult> {
    return this.callWithLogging('take_snapshot', { device });
  }
}
```

## Current Implementation Status
- ❌ `DeviceService.takeSnapshot()` method missing
- ❌ Snapshot operations not available
- ❌ Permission testing broken
- ✅ Other DeviceService methods working (getCameraList, getCameraStatus)

## Recommended Solution

### Implementation Required
1. **Add `takeSnapshot` method** to `DeviceService` class
2. **Implement proper error handling** for snapshot failures
3. **Add method to IAPIClient interface** if needed
4. **Update tests** to handle proper permission errors vs missing method errors

### Code Implementation
```typescript
// In DeviceService.ts
async takeSnapshot(device: string): Promise<SnapshotResult> {
  return this.callWithLogging('take_snapshot', { device }, 'TakeSnapshot');
}
```

### Test Updates Required
1. **Update error expectations** from "not a function" to proper permission errors
2. **Validate snapshot results** when method is implemented
3. **Test permission boundaries** properly

## Testing Requirements
- Implement `DeviceService.takeSnapshot()` method
- Fix permission testing to expect proper errors, not missing method errors
- Validate snapshot functionality works with real server
- Test viewer vs operator permission boundaries

## Classification
**Implementation Bug** - Missing critical API method in DeviceService class.

## Priority Justification
**High priority** because:
- ❌ Core functionality missing (snapshot operations)
- ❌ Permission testing broken
- ❌ Multiple test suites affected
- ⚠️ Required for complete API coverage

## Effort Estimate
- **Low-Medium complexity** - Method implementation and test updates
- **Multiple test suites affected** - Snapshot and permission tests
- **Estimated time**: 1-2 hours to implement method and fix tests

## Dependencies
- Requires `take_snapshot` JSON-RPC method on server
- Depends on proper authentication for permission testing
- May require `SnapshotResult` type definition
