# BUG-016: Authentication Token Environment Issue

## Summary
Integration tests are failing because authentication tokens are not being loaded from the test environment, causing widespread authentication failures across all test suites.

## Impact
- **63 failed tests** out of 153 total tests
- **12 failed test suites** out of 14 total
- **Critical**: All authenticated operations failing
- **Blocking**: Cannot validate real functionality

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Environment Variable Loading
- Tests require `.test_env` file to be sourced for authentication tokens
- Without proper environment loading, tests receive "Authentication failed. Please log in again."
- Error code: `-32001` with reason `auth_required`

### Secondary Issues Identified
1. **Auto-subscription failures**: WebSocket service attempts to subscribe to events before authentication
2. **Token validation**: Server rejects unauthenticated requests with proper JSON-RPC error format
3. **Test isolation**: Some tests pass (basic connectivity) while authenticated tests fail

## Evidence

### Error Pattern
```
Failed to subscribe to events: Error: Authentication failed. Please log in again.
{
  code: -32001,
  data: {
    reason: 'auth_required',
    details: 'Authentication required',
    suggestion: 'Authenticate first'
  }
}
```

### Affected Test Suites
- `server_connectivity.test.ts`: 8/12 tests failing
- `authenticated_functionality.test.ts`: 4/7 tests failing  
- `real_functionality.test.ts`: 2/8 tests failing
- `contract_validation.test.ts`: 1/7 tests failing
- `notification_security.test.ts`: 2/2 tests failing

### Working Test Suites
- `basic_connectivity.test.ts`: All tests passing (no auth required)
- `ping_api.test.ts`: All tests passing (no auth required)
- `camera_operations.test.ts`: 13/15 tests passing (auth working)

## Architecture Compliance Status
- ✅ **JSON-RPC Error Format**: Server correctly returns `-32001` auth errors
- ✅ **Error Structure**: Proper error codes and descriptive messages
- ❌ **Test Environment**: Integration tests not loading authentication tokens
- ❌ **Authentication Flow**: Tests failing to authenticate before operations

## Recommended Solution

### Immediate Fix
1. **Ensure `.test_env` is sourced** in all integration test scripts
2. **Verify token format** matches server expectations
3. **Add authentication validation** to test setup

### Test Environment Fix
```bash
# In test scripts, ensure:
source .test_env
npm run test:integration
```

### Authentication Flow Fix
1. **Pre-authenticate** in test setup before any operations
2. **Validate token format** before making API calls
3. **Handle auth failures** gracefully in test teardown

## Testing Requirements
- Fix environment variable loading in integration tests
- Ensure all authenticated operations work with proper tokens
- Validate that authentication tokens are correctly formatted
- Test authentication flow end-to-end

## Classification
**Critical Infrastructure Bug** - Environment configuration issue preventing integration test validation.

## Priority Justification
**Critical priority** because:
- ❌ Blocks all integration testing
- ❌ Cannot validate real server functionality  
- ❌ Prevents software convergence validation
- ⚠️ Required for production readiness assessment

## Effort Estimate
- **Low complexity** - Environment configuration fix
- **All integration tests affected** - 63 failing tests
- **Estimated time**: 30-60 minutes to fix environment loading and validate

## Dependencies
- Requires valid authentication tokens in `.test_env`
- Depends on server being available at `ws://localhost:8002/ws`
- May require token refresh if expired
