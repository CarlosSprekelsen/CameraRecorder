# BUG-027: Performance Test Timeouts

## Summary
Performance tests are timing out during sustained load testing, indicating potential performance issues or inadequate test timeouts.

## Affected Tests
- **Load Testing**: `REQ-PERF-006: Load Testing â€º should handle sustained load`
- **Timeout**: Exceeded 30 second timeout limit
- **Impact**: Cannot validate system performance under load

## Error Details
```
thrown: "Exceeded timeout of 30000 ms for a test.
Add a timeout value to this test to increase the timeout, if this is a long-running test."
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Inadequate Timeout**: 30-second timeout may be insufficient for sustained load testing
2. **Performance Issues**: System may be struggling under load
3. **Resource Constraints**: Server may not have sufficient resources for load testing
4. **Test Design**: Load test may be too intensive for current environment

## Expected Behavior
- Performance tests should complete within reasonable time limits
- System should handle sustained load without timeouts
- Load testing should validate performance requirements

## Impact
**MEDIUM** - Blocks performance validation but doesn't affect core functionality

## Priority
**MEDIUM** - Performance testing is important but not critical for basic functionality

**Performance/Testing Team**

## Files to Investigate
- `tests/integration/performance.test.ts` (line 166)
- Load testing implementation
- Performance requirements and targets
- Test timeout configurations

## Resolution Steps
1. Review performance test timeout requirements
2. Increase timeout for sustained load tests (if appropriate)
3. Optimize load testing to be more realistic
4. Investigate system performance under load
5. Consider reducing load test intensity for CI/CD environment
6. Add performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks
