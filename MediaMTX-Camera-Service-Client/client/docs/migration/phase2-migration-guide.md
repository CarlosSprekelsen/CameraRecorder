# Phase 2 Migration Guide: Store Refactoring & Error Boundaries

**Date**: January 15, 2025  
**Version**: Phase 2 Implementation  
**Status**: In Progress  

## Overview

Phase 2 focuses on store refactoring to follow the Single Responsibility Principle and implementing comprehensive error boundaries for better error handling and recovery.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Store Refactoring

#### Connection Store Split

**Before**: Single monolithic `connectionStore.ts` (817 lines)  
**After**: Modular connection stores following Single Responsibility Principle

**New Store Structure**:
```
stores/connection/
├── connectionStore.ts    # Core connection state (200 lines)
├── healthStore.ts        # Health monitoring (150 lines)
├── metricsStore.ts       # Performance metrics (180 lines)
└── index.ts             # Unified interface
```

**Benefits**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each store handles one concern
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify
- **Testability**: Smaller, focused stores are easier to test
- **Performance**: Reduced re-renders by isolating state changes

#### Migration Path

**For Components Using Connection Store**:

```typescript
// OLD: Direct access to monolithic store
import { useConnectionStore } from '../stores/connectionStore';

// NEW: Use specific stores or unified interface
import { useConnectionStore, useHealthStore, useMetricsStore } from '../stores/connection';
// OR
import { useUnifiedConnectionState } from '../stores/connection';
```

**Store Usage Examples**:

```typescript
// Core connection state
const { status, isConnected, error } = useConnectionStore();

// Health monitoring
const { healthScore, connectionQuality, latency } = useHealthStore();

// Performance metrics
const { messageCount, averageResponseTime } = useMetricsStore();

// Unified interface (for components needing all connection data)
const connectionState = useUnifiedConnectionState();
```

### 2. Error Boundary Implementation

#### Feature-Level Error Boundaries

**New Component**: `FeatureErrorBoundary`  
**Purpose**: Catch errors within specific features and provide recovery options

**Usage**:
```typescript
<FeatureErrorBoundary featureName="CameraDetail">
  <CameraDetail />
</FeatureErrorBoundary>
```

**Features**:
- **Automatic Retry**: Up to 3 retry attempts
- **Error Logging**: Structured logging with context
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error messages for users
- **Development Details**: Error details in development mode
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback UI when errors occur

#### Service-Level Error Boundaries

**New Component**: `ServiceErrorBoundary`  
**Purpose**: Catch errors in service operations and handle service degradation

**Usage**:
```typescript
<ServiceErrorBoundary serviceName="ConnectionManager" retryable={true}>
  <ConnectionManager />
</ServiceErrorBoundary>
```

**Features**:
- **Service-Specific Recovery**: Different strategies for different services
- **Fallback Mode**: Graceful degradation when services fail
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry attempts with backoff
- **Service Monitoring**: Track service health and failures

#### App-Level Error Boundary Integration

**Updated**: `App.tsx` with comprehensive error boundary coverage

**Structure**:
```typescript
<ErrorBoundary> {/* Root level */}
  <ServiceErrorBoundary serviceName="ConnectionManager">
    <ConnectionManager>
      <Router>
        <Routes>
          <Route element={
            <FeatureErrorBoundary featureName="Dashboard">
              <Dashboard />
            </FeatureErrorBoundary>
          } />
          {/* All routes wrapped with FeatureErrorBoundary */}
        </Routes>
      </Router>
    </ConnectionManager>
  </ServiceErrorBoundary>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### 3. Error Handling Improvements

#### Structured Error Logging

**Integration**: All error boundaries use centralized logging service

**Error Context**:
- Component/feature name
- Error type and message
- Retry attempts
- User actions leading to error
- Stack traces (development only)

#### Error Recovery Strategies

**Automatic Recovery**:
- Retry failed operations
- Fallback to alternative services
- Graceful degradation of features

**User-Initiated Recovery**:
- Manual retry buttons
- Page reload options
- Service restart capabilities

## Migration Checklist

### For Developers

- [ ] Update imports to use new modular stores
- [ ] Replace monolithic store access with specific stores
- [ ] Test error boundary behavior in development
- [ ] Verify error logging and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Update component error handling patterns

### For Components

- [ ] Use appropriate store for specific data needs
- [ ] Implement proper error handling in async operations
- [ ] Add error boundaries around complex components
- [ ] Test error scenarios and recovery flows

### For Services

- [ ] Implement proper error handling with custom error classes
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Provide fallback mechanisms for service failures
- [ ] Log service errors with proper context

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test individual store functionality
- Test error boundary error catching
- Test error recovery mechanisms
- Test store state isolation

### Integration Tests
- Test store interactions
- Test error boundary integration
- Test service error handling
- Test error logging

### Manual Testing
- Test error scenarios in development
- Verify error boundary UI
- Test retry and recovery mechanisms
- Check error logging output

## Performance Impact

### Store Refactoring Benefits
- **Reduced Re-renders**: Smaller stores mean fewer unnecessary re-renders
- **Better Memory Usage**: Isolated state reduces memory footprint
- **Improved Performance**: Focused state updates are more efficient

### Error Boundary Overhead
- **Minimal Impact**: Error boundaries only activate on errors
- **Development Mode**: Additional logging in development only
- **Production Optimized**: Minimal overhead in production builds

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during migration:

1. **Immediate**: Revert to monolithic connection store
2. **Error Boundaries**: Disable feature-level error boundaries
3. **Store Access**: Fall back to direct store access patterns

## Next Steps

### Phase 3 Preparation
- Monitor store performance and usage patterns
- Identify additional components for error boundary coverage
- Plan WebSocket reconnection hardening
- Prepare performance optimization strategy

### Documentation Updates
- Update store usage documentation
- Create error handling best practices guide
- Document error recovery procedures
- Update architectural decision records

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All stores follow Single Responsibility Principle
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and handle 100% of component errors
- [ ] Store re-renders reduced by 30%+
- [ ] Error recovery success rate > 90%
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved
