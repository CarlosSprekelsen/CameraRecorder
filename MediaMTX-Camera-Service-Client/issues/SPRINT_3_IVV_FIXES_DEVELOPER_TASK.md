# Sprint 3 IV&V Fixes - Developer Task

**Issue Type:** Performance & Feature Implementation  
**Priority:** High  
**Affects:** Sprint 3 Completion  
**Assigned:** Developer  
**Reported:** 2025-08-18  
**IV&V Status:** Authentication working, performance and real-time features need implementation

## Task Overview

Fix the remaining Sprint 3 issues identified by IV&V testing. Authentication is now working correctly, but performance requirements and real-time features need implementation to meet Sprint 3 completion criteria.

## IV&V Findings Summary

### ✅ RESOLVED ISSUES
- **Authentication**: JWT authentication now working correctly with proper secret
- **Core API Methods**: All 9 JSON-RPC methods functional
- **Basic Operations**: ping, get_camera_list, get_camera_status working

### ❌ REMAINING ISSUES TO FIX

#### 1. Performance Issues (Critical)
- **Problem**: Media operations taking ~3 seconds (requirement: <2s)
- **Affected Methods**: take_snapshot, start_recording, stop_recording, list_recordings, list_snapshots
- **Impact**: Fails Sprint 3 performance requirements

#### 2. Real-time Notifications (Critical)
- **Problem**: No WebSocket notifications during operations
- **Missing**: camera_status_update, recording_status_update notifications
- **Impact**: No real-time user feedback

#### 3. HTTP Polling Fallback (Medium)
- **Problem**: HTTP endpoint not implemented for WebSocket fallback
- **Missing**: /api/cameras endpoint for polling
- **Impact**: No fallback when WebSocket fails

## Detailed Developer Tasks

### Task 1: Performance Optimization (Critical Priority)

**Objective**: Reduce response times for media operations to <2 seconds

**Current Performance:**
- take_snapshot: ~3.07s (should be <2s)
- start_recording: ~3.07s (should be <2s)
- stop_recording: ~3.08s (should be <2s)
- list_recordings: ~3.08s (should be <2s)
- list_snapshots: ~3.08s (should be <2s)

**Investigation Required:**
1. **Server-side Performance Analysis**
   - Profile server-side execution time for each operation
   - Identify bottlenecks in media processing pipeline
   - Check for unnecessary blocking operations
   - Analyze file I/O performance

2. **Client-side Optimization**
   - Implement request timeout handling
   - Add progress indicators for long operations
   - Optimize WebSocket message handling
   - Consider async/await patterns for better responsiveness

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Implement caching for camera list and status
   - Cache file listings to reduce repeated API calls
   - Consider in-memory caching for frequently accessed data

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All media operations complete in <2 seconds
- Progress indicators show operation status
- No timeout errors during normal operations

### Task 2: Real-time Notification Implementation (Critical Priority)

**Objective**: Implement WebSocket notifications for real-time updates

**Required Notifications:**
1. **Camera Status Updates**
   ```json
   {
     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
     "method": "camera_status_update",
     "params": {
       "device": "/dev/video0",
       "status": "CONNECTED",
       "metrics": {...}
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Recording Status Updates**
   ```json
   {
     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
     "method": "recording_status_update",
     "params": {
       "device": "/dev/video0",
       "session_id": "uuid",
       "status": "STARTED|STOPPED|ERROR",
       "progress": 75
     }
   }
   ```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Server-side Notification System**
   - Implement notification broadcasting in WebSocket server
   - Add notification triggers for camera events
   - Add notification triggers for recording events
   - Ensure notifications are sent to all connected clients

2. **Client-side Notification Handling**
   - Implement notification event handlers
   - Update UI components to respond to real-time updates
   - Add notification state management
   - Implement notification filtering and routing

3. **Testing Real-time Features**
   - Test notifications during recording start/stop
   - Test camera status change notifications
   - Validate notification delivery to multiple clients
   - Test notification handling during connection interruptions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Real-time notifications received during operations
- UI updates immediately when notifications arrive
- Notifications work for multiple concurrent clients
- Graceful handling of notification failures

### Task 3: HTTP Polling Fallback Implementation (Medium Priority)

**Objective**: Implement HTTP polling endpoint for WebSocket fallback

**Required Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/cameras
Response: JSON with camera list and status
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Server-side HTTP Endpoint**
   - Add HTTP endpoint for camera status
   - Implement same data format as WebSocket API
   - Add authentication support for HTTP requests
   - Ensure endpoint returns same data as WebSocket methods

2. **Client-side Fallback Logic**
   - Implement WebSocket connection failure detection
   - Add automatic fallback to HTTP polling
   - Implement polling interval management
   - Add reconnection logic back to WebSocket

3. **Testing Fallback Mechanism**
   - Test HTTP endpoint with authentication
   - Test automatic fallback when WebSocket fails
   - Test reconnection to WebSocket when available
   - Validate data consistency between WebSocket and HTTP

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- HTTP endpoint returns valid JSON responses
- Client automatically falls back to HTTP when WebSocket fails
- Client reconnects to WebSocket when available
- No data loss during fallback transitions

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Requirements
- Follow existing code patterns and architecture
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include proper logging for debugging
- Maintain type safety with TypeScript
- Add unit tests for new functionality

### Testing Requirements
- Test all changes with real server integration
- Validate performance improvements with timing measurements
- Test real-time notifications with multiple clients
- Test fallback mechanisms under various failure scenarios
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Documentation Requirements
- Update API documentation for new endpoints
- Document notification event types and payloads
- Update client usage examples
- Document performance optimization techniques used

## Success Criteria

**Sprint 3 Completion Requirements:**
- ✅ All API methods working (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Authentication working (COMPLETED)
- ❌ Performance <2s response time (TO BE FIXED)
- ❌ Real-time notifications working (TO BE FIXED)
- ❌ HTTP fallback mechanism (TO BE FIXED)

**Definition of Done:**
1. All performance issues resolved (<2s response time)
2. Real-time notifications implemented and tested
3. HTTP polling fallback implemented and tested
4. All tests passing with real server integration
5. Documentation updated
6. IV&V validation successful

## Timeline

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days
- Day 1: Performance investigation and optimization
- Day 2: Real-time notification implementation
- Day 3: HTTP fallback implementation and testing

**Dependencies:**
- Server team collaboration for performance optimization
- Access to real camera hardware for testing
- IV&V validation after implementation

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk:**
- Performance optimization may require server-side changes
- Real-time notifications may impact server performance
- Complex WebSocket/HTTP fallback logic

**Mitigation:**
- Start with performance profiling to identify bottlenecks
- Implement notifications incrementally
- Test fallback mechanism thoroughly before deployment
