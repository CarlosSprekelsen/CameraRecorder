## **Gate Framework Overview**

### **Gate Purpose**
Systems Engineering gates provide controlled checkpoints that:

- **Control progression** between development phases
- **Validate readiness** before advancing to next phase

### **Gate Types**

- **PDR (Preliminary Design Review)**: Core implementation validation
- **CDR (Critical Design Review)**: Production readiness authorization

### **Gate Authority**
- **Gate Chair**: Project Manager
- **Technical Authority**: IV&V
- **Implementation Authority**: Developer
- **Decision Authority**: Project Manager (final gate pass/fail)
