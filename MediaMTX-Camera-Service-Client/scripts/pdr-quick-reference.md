## Quick Start Commands

### Start PDR Execution
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd MediaMTX-Camera-Service-Client

# Review PDR execution scripts
cat scripts/pdr-execution-scripts.md

# Check current project status
cat docs/development/client-roadmap.md | grep -A 5 "PDR"
```

### Evidence Directory Structure
```bash
# Create evidence directory (if not exists)
mkdir -p evidence/client-pdr

# List evidence files
ls -la evidence/client-pdr/

# Check Sprint 3 completion status
cat evidence/client-sprint-3/11_sprint_3_completion_review.md
```

### Validation Tests
```bash
# Test WebSocket integration
node evidence/client-sprint-3/test-websocket-integration.js

# Test file download functionality
node evidence/client-sprint-3/test-file-download.js

# Check server status
sudo systemctl status camera-service
```
